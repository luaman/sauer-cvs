if you got your hands on Sauerbraten as a non-programmer, there is very little
to see at the moment. As a player especially, you will see some textured cubes,
and wonder what the fuss is all about.

As a very adventurous mapper, there are some things you can try to get a taste of
things to come, but you are probably better of waiting for more mature builds.

That said:

The Sauerbraten player/mapper directory is the nested "sauerbraten" directory.
It has a similar structure to the cube distribution, with lots of stuff stripped
out. Everything outside this directory is programmer only.

run sauerbraten.bat

E - to get into edit mode, as in Cube.

look around to see a square appear on walls around you (doesn't always work
correctly yet): any editing actions are based on this cursor, you don't
need a selection

scroll mousewheel - push or pull an entire cube 1/8th at a time
hold G + scroll mousewheel - change grid size
hold F + scroll mousewheel - push or pull an entire cube
hold R + scroll mousewheel - push or pull the corner or a cube 1/8th at a time,
                             here it matters which corner you point at

Alternatively, you can drag a selection, which again is corner based.
try out different selections, you will see how powerful they are (you
can make dents made up of corners of multiple cubes very quickly!).
Press space to de-select.
