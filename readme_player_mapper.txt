Sauerbraten is not yet mature as either game or engine, but as an adventurous
mapper/player there is already a lot of fun to be had.

The Sauerbraten player/mapper directory is the nested "sauerbraten" directory.
It has a similar structure to the cube distribution.
Everything outside this directory is programmer only.

run sauerbraten.bat

E - to get into edit mode, as in Cube. Read the "docs" folder for more in-depth
help. The in-game editing help menu is useful too.

look around to see a square appear on walls around you (doesn't always work
correctly yet): any editing actions are based on this cursor, you don't
need a selection

scroll mousewheel - push or pull an entire cube | push pull selection an 8th if corners are selected
hold G + scroll mousewheel - change grid size
hold F + scroll mousewheel - push or pull an entire cube 1/8th at a time
hold R + scroll mousewheel - push or pull the corner or a cube 1/8th at a time,
                             here it matters which corner you point at

Alternatively, you can drag a selection (left mouse) which selects whole cubes or (middle mouse)
to make a selection involving any corners). try out different selections, you will see how powerful
they are (you can make dents made up of corners of multiple cubes very quickly!).
Press space to de-select.
