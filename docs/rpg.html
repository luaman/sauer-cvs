<h2 id="gameplay_scripting">Gameplay Scripting</h2>


<p>
The RPG is set up in a very open way such that all gameplay objects and behaviour can be modified in a script file,
currently in data/game_rpg.cfg (this will change later to be on a per-map basis). The idea is that every map comes with its own "mod",
    and that gameplay can be influenced by level designer, allowing gameplay types spanning
    from a stat/story influenced FPS game, an action RPG, all the way to more complex
    quest/story/stat based RPGs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
This file simply lists all gameplay objects, which can then be placed in the level editor. For example, by writing:
</p>

<pre id="spawn_apple">spawn_apple = [ r_worth 20 ]</pre>

<p>
you define a script that gets executed when an apple is spawned. You place this apple either directly in the world or as part of another objects inventory.
To place it in the world, you create an entity of type "spawn" with a name attached. This is best done by typing (in the console):
</p>

<pre id="newrpgspawn">newrpgspawn apple</pre>

<p>
    which will show you your new entity in the editor. Running the map then will create
    a new apple object at that location, with all stats set to your liking (in this
    case just its worth).</p>
    <p>
What is important to realize is that most r_ commands work with what is called the RPG stack. This makes it possible to apply
properties and actions to things without having to specify all the time which object you are talking about. For example, when the
spawn_apple script gets executed, the apple object will be on the top of the RPG stack, so any commands such as r_worth that apply to an
object, will automatically apply to it. It is a stack, because during the initialization of one object you may spawn another, which means
all r_ commands will apply to the new object, until it is done, when the RPG stack returns to the previous object.
    </p>

<p>
Following is a list of all commands... unless otherwise noted, they apply to the current object (top of the RPG stack).
</p>

<h2 id="rpg_object_commands">RPG object commands</h2>


<pre id="r_pop">r_pop</pre>
<p>
Removes the top object from the RPG stack
</p>

<pre id="r_spawn">r_spawn N</pre>
<p>
creates a new object, places it on the top of the RPG stack, then executes spawn_N to initialize it.
</p>

<pre id="r_contain">r_contain T</pre>
<p>
Takes the object on the top of the stack, and makes it part of the inventory of the object on the stack below it.
T is the type of inventory object, see the convenient scripts r_inventory, r_loot, r_fortrade instead.
</p>

<pre id="r_gold">r_gold G</pre>
<p>
G gold is owned by this object for use in trading. Only makes sense for player/NPCs
</p>

<pre id="r_worth">r_worth V</pre>
<p>
This object has base value V when used in trading
</p>

<pre id="r_model">r_model M</pre>
<p>
Specify model M to represent this object visually when placed in the world
</p>

<pre id="r_ai">r_ai</pre>
<p>
Signifies that this object should run AI code when placed in the world, used for NPCs/monsters, not items.
</p>

<pre id="r_action">r_action N A</pre>
<p>
defines a custom action the player can take on this object. N is the tag word that describes the action, visible in
the objects menu in the game world, and A is the script that gets executed when the player selects it.
</p>

<pre id="r_say">r_say T</pre>
<p>
Make text T the last thing this object said to the player
</p>

<pre id="r_take">r_take N A NA</pre>
<p>
Attempt to take object with name N from the player inventory, and place it in the objects inventory. If the item was succesfully grabbed (it was present),
action A is executed. If the item was not available, NA is executed. r_take is the preferred way to structure resolution of quests, i.e. everything the player ever
needs to do should go via token items.
</p>

<pre id="r_give">r_give N</pre>
<p>
give the player an item with name N
</p>



<h2 id="H2_1">RPG stats</h2>

The following is a list of all stats tracked by each object. A stat is defined as a property of an object that determines its effectiveness when performing a certain action,
i.e. the "melee" stat affects your melee combat effectiveness. Stats are things that you can build up thuout the game, hence "health" is not a stat, but it is dependent on a stat, maxhp.

                it is time based, so your effectiveness depends on being able to give or take sustained
                damage, and deals better with the effects of running away mid-fight etc.</td>

    </table>
    <br />
    a stat can be set on any rpg object using the r_X command, where X is any of the
    above stat names, e.g. <span style="font-family: Courier New">r_melee 50</span>
    gives the current object 50 melee points.<br />
    a script can read the current points using r_get_X, i.e. <span style="font-family: Courier New">
        echo "your melee points are: " (r_get_melee)</span> outputs the current objects
    melee points.<br />
    <br />
    A special case are objects that have no stats set directly (typically the player,
    and sometimes NPCs): their stats are computed as cumulative from the stats of all
    their inventory items. So if the player carries a gem that has melee 50, and gloves
    that have melee 20, his own melee points are 70.<br />
    <br />
    It's important to realize that stat points do not directly translate to damage and
    such. Points are an indication of efficiency of a particular stat over the base
    100%, along a logarithmic curve. So 0 melee points translates into 100% melee efficiency,
    and what 70 melee points translates into... well, something above 100%, depending
    on the log curve. Every map can define their own log curve for each stat, depending
    on how fast you want points to result in increased melee damage. This is a game
    balancing thing, in the sense that if the game world makes obtain items with melee
    points too easy and the log curve is too gentle, then players will be overpowered.
    The formula for melee is (other stats work similarly):<br />
    <br />
    <span style="font-family: Courier New">meleedamage = weapondamage * ( log ( points /
        pointsscale + 1 ) * percentscale + 100 ) / 100<br />
    </span>
    <br />
    (log = natural logarithm). so with a pointscale of 10, and a percentscale of 25,
    our 70 points amount to a 152% melee efficiency, which, when combined with a weapon
    that does 10 damage (at 100%), now does 15 melee damage. For movespeed you'd have
    a similar formula, where instead of weapondamage you'd have the default running
    speed.<br />
    <br />
    That may seem like a really convoluted way of doing things, but the log scale is
    the only way to give a relatively constant challenge level in the game. Without
    it, the game would start hard and become too easy real soon. The UI will show both
    points and efficiency for stats so you can easy see the effect without understanding
    the math.<br />
    <br />
    You can define the log scale by doing: <span style="font-family: Courier New">r_def_X
        pointscale percentscale</span>, but this should only really ever be done by
    the game designer, or experienced rpg level designers on their own levels, as tweaking
    these values requires deep insight into how players will collect points thruout
    a game.<br />
    <br />
    It is worth repeating what should be obvious from the above: the player and npcs
    don't have "levels" as in other RPGs. Increased ability is purely denoted by means
    of points and efficiency above whatever is the 100% value of the related ability.
    The end result is similar to traditional RPGs, but not quite. The above system is
    more flexible in the sense that you can have completely independent "levels" for
    all your abilities. But best of all, since your points are determined by what you
    have in your inventory, any way you can get items can increase your ability, which
    includes killing, stealing, finding, trading etc. You can change how you assign
    your priorities mid-game, by trading melee items for magic items, for example. You
    won't hit a "item plateau" as in so many RPG games 20% into the game because most
    items you get are useless, here you can put everything to <em>some</em> use, even
    if sometimes minimal.<br />
