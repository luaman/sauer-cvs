MD3 in Sauerbraten v2006_01_31
==


Sauerbraten supports now md3 player models and monsters, but no md3 mapmodels yet.
This doc describes how to get those models to work. Jump to section 7 if you need a
sample md3 model that works out of the box.

1.  Create the directory "yourmd3" in sauerbraten/packages/models/monster


2.  Create the file animation.cfg in sauerbraten/packages/models/monster/yourmd3
    This file holds the information for the animation frames, fps, etc.


3.  Use the command "md3animation" in the "animation.cfg" file to specify each 
    animation of your model.

    Usage:  md3animation FIRST_FRAME NUM_FRAMES LOOPING FRAMES FPS
    
    Your "animation.cfg" could now look like this:
    
    // animation config file
    // sex	m
    // headoffset	-8 0 -1
    // footsteps	boot
    // first frame, num frames, looping frames, frames per second
    md3animation	0	30	0	20		// BOTH_DEATH1
    md3animation    30	1	0	25		// BOTH_DEAD1
    md3animation    31	29	0	15		// BOTH_DEATH2
    md3animation    60	1	0	25		// BOTH_DEAD2
    md3animation    61	29	0	15		// BOTH_DEATH3
    md3animation    90	1	0	25		// BOTH_DEAD3
    md3animation    91	40	0	18		// TORSO_GESTURE
    md3animation    131	6	0	15		// TORSO_ATTACK		(MUST NOT CHANGE -- hand animation is synced to this)
    md3animation    137	6	0	15		// TORSO_ATTACK2	(MUST NOT CHANGE -- hand animation is synced to this)
    md3animation    143	5	0	20		// TORSO_DROP		(MUST NOT CHANGE -- hand animation is synced to this)
    md3animation    148	4	0	20		// TORSO_RAISE		(MUST NOT CHANGE -- hand animation is synced to this)
    md3animation    152	1	0	15		// TORSO_STAND
    md3animation    153	1	0	15		// TORSO_STAND2
    md3animation    154	9	9	15		// LEGS_WALKCR
    md3animation    163	13	13	16		// LEGS_WALK
    md3animation    177	10	10	18		// LEGS_RUN
    md3animation    188	11	11	20		// LEGS_BACK
    md3animation    199	11	11	15		// LEGS_SWIM
    md3animation    210	8	0	15		// LEGS_JUMP
    md3animation    218	1	0	15		// LEGS_LAND
    md3animation    219	8	0	12		// LEGS_JUMPB
    md3animation    226	1	0	15		// LEGS_LANDB
    md3animation    227	30	30	30		// LEGS_IDLE
    md3animation    257	1	1	15		// LEGS_IDLECR
    md3animation    258	7	7	15		// LEGS_TURN


4.  Your model should consist of these submodels, placed in the "yourmd3" directory:
    
    head.md3
    upper.md3
    lower.md3
    
    For each of them create a SUBMODEL_default.cfg
    As example, head_default.cfg, etc.
    
    
5.  In the SUBMODEL_default.cfg, you can use the command "md3skin" to specify the 
    skin you want to assign to each mesh of the submodel.
    
    Usage:  md3skin MESH_NAME REL_SKIN_PATH
    
    As example, I placed the skin "default_h.jpg" into the "yourmd3" directory.
    To assign it to the head part of my model, I put this line into "head_default.cfg":
    
    md3skin h_head ./default_h.jpg
    
    This assigns the "default_h.jpg" skin to the "h_head" mesh of the "head.md3" submodel.
    
  
6.  To test the model ingame, you can replace a monster with it:

    In sauerbraten/packages/models/monster/ rename "ogro" to "ogro_bak".
    
    Then rename "yourmd3" to "ogro" and start Sauerbraten. You can now test the model by
    typing 
        
    /dmsp aard3
    
    If you replaced the ogro model, you could also try
    
    /thirdperson 1
    
    
7.  You can get a working sample model at 

    http://sprintf.org/sauerbraten/md3_sample.tar.bz2
    
    Uncompress that file and copy the folder to sauerbraten/packages/models/monster/ and
    rename it as described in section 6.
