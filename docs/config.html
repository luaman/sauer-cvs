<h1>Instructions for Running Sauerbraten</h1>

<ul>
<li>For Windows: Install, edit, then run sauerbraten.bat.</li>
<li>For GNU/Linux: gunzip, <i>chmod +x sauerbraten_unix</i> and then <i>./sauerbraten_unix</i>. Needs a decent and compliant OpenGL implementation.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Sauerbraten derives its simplicity from some rather brute force rendering methods, and as such it needs 
a beefy machine to get good visual quality. It runs best with vertical sync (vsync) set to OFF and at high
refresh rates (otherwise, you may get excessive LOD/FPS variance).
</p>


<h1>Before You Start</h1>

<p>
Take some time to read the rest of this document, as it describes options and commands that may be crucial to a successful
experience with Sauerbraten.
</p>

<p>
You may want to look at the default configuration file "defaults.cfg" located in the "config" directory (which should look fairly
familiar if you've ever played a Quake style game). Should you wish to change any settings <i>before you start</i>, create a file
name "config.cfg" and set them there. Alternatively, if you would like to override settings (now, and in the future), use the file
named "autoexec.cfg".
</p>

<p>
Binding keys, as well as performance and gameplay related settings are documented below, these commands can be used in
both the console and configuration scripts. In addition, you can also press "ESC" to go into the menu, which will provide
you with an interface for navigating some (not all) of the commands.
</p>

<h1>Command Line Options</h1>

<pre>-d</pre>
<p>
This starts Sauerbraten as a dedicatated server. The default is a non-dedicated server with only a single client in graphical
mode. Dedicated servers run in the shell only (no graphics), with increased priority yet use very little cpu time and memory,
so you can run one in the background, or at the same time with a client if you want to host a game (which is usually better 
than using a listen server). Servers use the ports 28785 (UDP) and 28786 (UDP).
</p>
<p>
<i>Note: Servers need to be restarted every 3 weeks, otherwise at least one game will not have correct timing.</i>
</p>

<pre>-wN</pre>
<p>
Sets the screen resolution width to N (default: 640).
</p>

<pre>-hN</pre>
<p>
Sets the screen resolution height to N (default: 480).
</p>

<pre>-bN</pre>
<p>
Sets the screen to N bits per pixel.
</p>

<pre>-zN</pre>
<p>
Sets the z-buffer precision to N bits. This should be at least 24 or you may experience depth problems.
</p>

<pre>-aN</pre>
<p>
Sets FSAA (Full Scene AntiAliasing) to N samples, i.e. -a4 is 4xFSAA
</p>

<pre>-t</pre>
<p>
Sets Sauerbaten to run windowed.
</p>

<pre>
-f
-fN
</pre>
<p>
When used alone, "-f" forces the renderpath to the old fixed function pipeline (no shaders), otherwise it sets the shader precision
to N (lower = faster). 0 disables shaders, 1 uses the fastest/lowest precision the OpenGL driver offers, 2 is the default precision,
and 3 is the nicest/slowest precision. The effects of 1-3 will vary with different card/driver combos.
</p>
<p>
If your setup is considered weak, "-f2" will fall back to "-f1" automatically, unless you use "-f3". Weak renderers include (but not limited to): "GeForce FX",
"Quadro FX", "6200", "9500", "9550", "9600", "9700", "9800", "X300", "X600", "FireGL", "Intel", "Chrome".
</p>

<pre>-lS</pre>
<p>
Loads map S on startup (default: base/metl4).
</p>

<pre>-uN</pre>
<p>
Sets the server upstream bandwidth to N bytes per second. Only set this parameter if you know what you are doing,
specifying a wrong value is worse than not specifying it at all.
</p>

<pre>-nN</pre>
<p>
Sets the server description, for people pinging the server. usually does not need to be set if you have a descriptive
domain name already, but if you set it, keep it short as it may otherwise be truncated (example: -n"Bobs Instagib Server").
</p>

<pre>-cN</pre>
<p>
Sets the max number of clients to N. The default is 4. If you want to set it higher, be aware that bandwidth usage almost
doubles with each extra client, so only do this if the server runs on a serious pipe (not your home DSL or Cable connection).
</p>

<pre>-iS</pre>
<p>
Sets the server ip to S. This option is only useful for people running on machines with multiple network interfaces.
</p>

<pre>-mS</pre>
<p>
Sets the master server to use for either server (registering) and client (updating) to S. Be aware, this is the base url
of the master server and has to end in a "/" and without a "http://" prefix (default: sauerbraten.org/masterserver/).
</p>

<pre>-gS</pre>
<p>
Start playing using gametype S (default: fps). This is currently used to access Eisenstern, Sauerbratens RPG game (use: -grpg).
</p>

<pre>-pS</pre>
<p>
Sets the server's administrative password to S.
</p>

<h1>General Console Commands and Configuration</h1>

<pre>
bind K A
editbind K A
</pre>
<p>
Binds key K to commands A (see console language below for what you can put in A). To find out what key names and their default
bindings are, look at data/keymap.cfg, then add bind commands to your autoexec.cfg. Editbind works much the same way, except
now the key is only available in edit mode (if no editbind is defined for a certain key, it will use the normal binding).
</p>

<pre>alias N A</pre>
<p>
Binds name N to commands A, after which you can use N as a shortcut for A. You 
may re-bind N as often as you like, call it recursively etc. You may use N = A as a shortcut for alias.
</p>

<pre>quit</pre>
<p>
Quits without asking.
</p>

<pre>
forward
backward
left
right
</pre>
<p>
Move you in said direction (default key: up down left right, w s a d).
</p>

<pre>attack</pre>
<p>
Fires the current weapon (default key: left mouse).
</p>

<pre>jump</pre>
<p>
Triggers a jump (default key: space, right mouse).
</p>

<pre>invmouse B</pre>
<p>
Toggles mouse between regular and inverted (flight sim) mode (default: 0 (uninverted)).
</p>

<pre>sensitivity S</pre>
<p>
Sets mouse sensitivity (default: 10). The feel of which should be a similar number to Quake.
</p>

<pre>sensitivityscale S</pre>
<p>
Scales the effect of an increase or decrease in the sensitivity value. The larger the value, the smaller the difference
between sensitivity values (default: 1).
</p>

<pre>maxfps N</pre>
<p>
Sets the max number of FPS (Frames per Second). Useful if you have a recent machine that can run the engine at close to 1000FPS,
or if you want to test. If you set maxfps to exactly or a simple ratio of your monitor's refresh rate, you may experience tearing.
Be aware that maxfps is not a replacement for vsync (default: 200).
</p>

<pre>fov N</pre>
<p>
Sets your FOV to 10..150.
</p>

<pre>shaderdetail N</pre>
<p>
This sets the level of detail shaders should use, for N=3 is highest, and N=0 is lowest. Lower settings will give speedups
on slower hardware.
</p>

<pre>loddistance N</pre>
<p>
Sets the distance at which world vertex array blocks are rendered at a higher 
LOD (level of detail). The lower this value, the more geometry popup you will 
see, but the faster it may render. Every system has a different&nbsp;optimal 
value, experiment. This variable only has an effect for large scale maps where 
the level designer has turned on LOD using the "lodsize" variable.&nbsp;
</p>

<pre>watersubdiv N</pre>
<p>
Determines the subdivision of the water surface in maps, which can greatly 
affect fps on slow machines. Must be a power of 2: 4 is the default, 8 is 
recommended for people on slow machines, 2 is nice for fast machines, and 1 is 
quite OTT. See the edit reference for more information on how to add the water material to your levels.
NOTE: This only effects water with shaders disabled!
</p>

<pre>waterlod N</pre>
<p>
Sets the precision level of the water LOD (Level of Detail) from 0..3, where 0 is the lowest and 3 is the highest setting
(default: 1).
NOTE: This only effects water with shaders disabled!
</p>

<pre>waterreflect B</pre>
<p>
Enables or disables water reflections, only works if your card supports GL_EXT_framebuffer_object and you don't run with
the fixed function pipeline (default: 1).
</p>

<pre>waterrefract B</pre>
<p>
Enables or disables water refractions, (default: 0).
</p>

<pre>reflectdist N</pre>
<p>
Sets the maximum distance geometry/objects can be at to be in a reflection from 0..10000 (default: 2000).
</p>

<pre>reflectfps N</pre>
<p>
Sets the amount of times per second the reflections are updated from 1..200 (default: 30). Use this if you would like to
improve the speed of reflections on fast machines, or to reduce to gain more speed for other operations. Be aware that setting
this to a value higher than "maxfps" has no effect.
</p>

<pre>reflectsize N</pre>
<p>
Sets the resolution of reflected surfaces (where the dimensions would measyre 2^N x 2^N), from 6..10 (default: 8). Lowering this value results
in a grainier image, whereas increasing it results in a finer and mroe detailed image. This too should be used to fine tune the speed of
reflection rendering.

<pre>maxreflect N</pre>
<p>
Sets the maximum number of reflection surfaces that can be visible at once from 1..8 (default: 3). Any surfaces exceeding this
limit will not be given reflections on their surfaces.
</p>

<pre>reflectmms B</pre>
<p>
Toggles whether map models are rendered in reflections (default: 1).
</p>

<pre>maxparticles N</pre>
<p>
Sets the maximum number of particles rendered at any one time. If more 
particles are generated than this number, the oldest ones are culled, so you 
can safely set this number relatively low without loss of information (default: 1000).
</p>

<pre>setfullscreenshader Name</pre>
<p>
Sets your favourite fullscreen shader. Active permanently once set. Use without name
argument to turn it off. Current example shaders: invert, gbr, sobel, bloom
</p>

<pre>screenshot</pre>
<p>
Writes out "screenshotN.bmp", where N is the number of milliseconds since the game was launched (default key: F12).
</p>

<pre>musicvol N
soundvol N</pre>
<p>
Sets the music/sound volume from 0..255.
</p>

<pre>soundbufferlen N</pre>
<p>
Sets the sound buffer length in bytes, tweak this if you experience stuttering or lagging sound (default: 512).
</p>

<pre>gamma N</pre>
<p>
Sets the hardware gamma value to N percent (default: 100). May not work if your card/driver doesn't support it.
</p>

<pre>hidestats B</pre>
<p>
Toggles display of fps/rendering stats on the HUD (default: 1).
</p>

<pre>hidehud B</pre>
<p>
Toggles the entire hud display, which includes rendering stats, ammo, and echoed text (default: 0).
</p>

<pre>maxroll N</pre>
<p>
Sets the maximum value your display will roll on strafing from 0..20 (default: 3)
</p>

<pre>crosshairsize N</pre>
<p>
Sets the size of your crosshair, 0 being off (default: 3).
</p>

<pre>crosshairfx B</pre>
<p>
Toggles crosshair effects (default: 1). When on, the crosshair will go grey when the weapon is reloading, orange when health &lt;= 50,
or red when &lt;=25.
</p>

<pre>exec S</pre>
<p>
Executes all commands in config file S.
</p>

<pre>newmenu S</pre>
<p>
Creates a new menu with name S. All following menuitem commands will apply to this menu.
</p>

<pre>
menuitem S A
menuitem A
</pre>
<p>
Creates a new menuitem with the name S, which will execute A when selected. If you only specify one parameter, then it will be used for both.
See "data/menus.cfg" for the defaults. If N starts with the special character "^", then the name will be evaluated as a command when
being displayed, and the the variable "S" used as name. This allows you to create menu items that depend on changing gamestate.
</p>

<pre>showmenu N</pre>
<p>
Displays the menu with name N previously defined, and allows the user to pick an item with the cursor keys. Upon pressing return,
the associated action will be executed. pressing ESC will cancel the menu.
</p>

<pre>history N</pre>
<p>
Executes the Nth command in the command line history. For example, binding "history 0" to a key allows you to quickly repeat the
last command typed in (useful for placing many identical entities etc.)
</p>

<pre>keymap K N A</pre>
<p>
Sets up the keymap for key code K with name N and default action A. You should 
never have to use this command manually, use "bind" instead.

<h1>CubeScript</h1>

<p>
Cube's console language is similar to console languages of other games (e.g. Quake), but is a bit more powerful in that it is a
full programming language.
</p>

<p>
What is similar to quake is the basic command structure: commands consist of 
the command itself, followed by any number of arguments seperated by 
whitespace. you can use "" to quote strings with whitespace in them (such as 
the actions in bind/alias), and whereever a command is required you can also 
use ; to sequence multiple commands in one.
</p>

<p>
What is new compared to quake is that you can evaluate aliases and expressions. 
You can substitute the value of an alias as an argument by prefixing it with a 
"$" sign, (example: echo The current value of x is $x). You can even 
substitute the values of console variables this way, i.e $fov gives the current 
fov. Some aliases are set automatically, for example $arg1 to $argN are set if 
you supply arguments when you execute an alias.
</p>

<p>
An alternative re two alternatives to "" for quoting a string: () and []. They work in
the same way as "", with the difference that they can be nested infinitely, and
that they may contain linefeeds (useful for larger scripts). () is different
from [] in that it evaluates the commands contained in it _before_ it evaluates
the surrounding command, and substitutes the results. () bracketed strings are
called expressions, and [] bracketed strings may be thought of as blocks.
</p>

<p>
An alternative to $x is @x, which uses an alias as a macro. The difference is that @x 
can be subtituted inside [] or () forms before they have ever been evaluated (at parse time), 
which makes them useful for composing strings or creating code on the fly. The @x form will be
substituted using the value of x at the time the enclosing [] is evaluated. You can add more @ prefixes
to move up more levels of []s, so @@x will move up two levels of []s and so on.
Example: x = 0; if $cond [x = 1; [x = 2; echo @@x]] will echo 0, since it uses the value of x at two levels up. 
</p>

<p>
The form @(body) is similar to @x, except that body contains commands executed at parse time.
The result value after body executes is substituted in for @(body). 
You may use multiple @ prefixes as with the @x form.
Example: @(result "Hello, World!") will substitute itself with Hello, World!
</p>

<p>
The following commands are available for programming:
</p>

<pre>
+ A B
- A B
* A B
div A B
mod A B
</pre>
<p>
(add, substract, multiply, divide, modulo): these all work like the integer 
operators from other languages (example: echo x squared is (* $x $x)).
</p>

<pre>
= A B
&lt; A B
&gt; A B
strcmp A B
</pre>
<p>
(equals, lessthan, greaterthan, stringcompare): comparison operators that return 1 for true and 0 for false.
</p>

<pre>if cond true false</pre>
<p>
Executes the true or false&nbsp;part depending on wether cond is "0" or 
something else (example: if (&lt; $x 10) [ echo "x is" $x ] [ echo "x is too big" ]).
</p>

<pre>loop I N body</pre>
<p>
Evaluates body N times, and sets the alias I from 0 to N-1 for every iteration (example: loop i 10 [ echo $i ]).
</p>

<pre>while cond body</pre>
<p>
Evaluates body while cond evaluates to true. Note that cond here has to have [], otherwise it would only be evaluated once
(example: i = 0; while [ (&lt; $i 10) ] [ echo $i; i = (+ $i 1) ]).
</p>

<pre>concat S...</pre>
<p>
Concatenates all the arguments and returns the result
</p>

<pre>concatword S...</pre>
<p>
Same as concat but without spaces between the elements.
</p>

<pre>format F V1..Vn</pre>
<p>
Substitutes the V values into the format string F and returns the result. The format strings %1 through %9 are substituted with V1 through V9, respectively, and may be
used multiple times. %% will generate a single % character (example: format "%1 bottles of %2 on the %3, %1 bottles of %2!" 99 beer wall).
</p>

<pre>at S N</pre>
<p>
Grabs the Nth word out of string S and returns the result
</p>

<pre>listlen L</pre>
<p>
Returns the number of items in the list L
</p>

<pre>onrelease A</pre>
<p>
Only executes A if the command is executed on the release of a key/button (must be in an action in a bind or an alias in a bind).
</p>

<pre>retval V</pre>
<p>
Normally the result of a [] block is the result of the last command in the block. If you want the result to be a particular
variable or value, you can use e.g. "retval $i" etc.
</p>

<p>Variables that are only really useful when used as value:</p>

<pre>$editing</pre>
<p>
This is true when in edit mode.
