<h1 id="toc0">Introduction</h1>
Your local documentation (README.html ff.) holds all the commands you can use,<br />
use it as reference for your current release.<br />
<br />
With scripting you can achieve a lot more personalized Sauerbraten experience;<br />
in most cases some simple copy-and-paste will do the trick.<br />
But this guide aims at showing some easy techniques to empower gamers and mappers alike.<br />
<br />
Any files you find in your game directory (and subdirs) ending in &quot;.cfg&quot; should contain CubeScript.<br />
Check them out to see what the engine already does via scripting ... and how!<br />
<br />
<h2 id="toc1">autoexec and config</h2>
To automatically run scripting on engine start you need only place them in a file called <tt>autoexec.cfg</tt> in your base game directory.<br />
If anything /funny/ happens - like key bindings not working anymore - you should be prepared to move (or even delete) your <tt>config.cfg</tt> (also in the base game directory). This file is also executed upon engine start and is useful to keep values from one run to the next, but this may result in bogus data being saved and so can require the mentioned removal to return to a clean setup.<br />
It will be written at every clean exit and if it doesn't exist will contain whatever is in <tt>./data/defaults.cfg</tt> - so never modify _that_ file!<br />
It helps to remind yourself that <tt>config.cfg</tt> is actually <em>merely</em> a <tt>saved.cfg</tt>!<br />
<br />
<h2 id="toc2">scripting newbie</h2>
Without being a programmer you might find a lot of this stuff too complicated for your taste,<br />
but do not despair! There are some examples on these pages to help you achieve a lot of goals and there are also quite a few scripts ready for download on <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.quadropolis.us" rel="nofollow">quadropolis</a>.<br />
<br />
But if you really want to get the most out of the engine it is suggested that you at least getting familiar with some basics of the scripting capabilities!<br />
Try reading the page on <a class="wiki_link" href="Scripting%20Tutorial.html">Scripting Tutorial</a> to see what fundamental know-how this is and how easy it is.<br />
<br />
<h1 id="toc3">Script 101</h1>
<h2 id="toc4">What happens at startup</h2>
Following files get executed:<br />

<pre><code>if config.cfg doesn't exist:
  only then do we execute data/defaults.cfg
  this will - at regular quit of engine -
  be written into config.cfg

if config.cfg exists:
  execute it

execute data/menus.cfg

if autoexec.cfg exists:
  execute it</code></pre>

<br />
<h2 id="toc5">What happens at mapload</h2>

<pre><code>data/default_map_settings.cfg is executed
if they exist
  packages/ ..PATH-to-package.cfg is executed
  packages/ ..PATH-to-Map.cfg is executed</code></pre>

<br />
<h2 id="toc6">What can I do with scripting myself?</h2>
Whatever you can describe as a combination of CubeScript-Blocks.<br />
<br />
<h1 id="toc7">CubeScript Topics</h1>
<h2 id="toc8">Syntax</h2>
The basic command structures of CubeScript are explained on the <a class="wiki_link" href="Scripting%20Syntax.html">Scripting Syntax</a> page<br />
Some introductory words on selected commands can be found on this <a class="wiki_link" href="Scripting%20Commands.html">Scripting Commands</a> summary.<br />
For programming you should be aware of the <a class="wiki_link" href="Scripting%20Flow%20Control.html">flow control possibilities</a>.<br />
<br />
<h2 id="toc9">Map Configuration</h2>
Scripting for maps is explained on the <a class="wiki_link" href="Map%20Config%20and%20Scripting.html">Map Config and Scripting</a>.<br />
<br />
<h2 id="toc10">Menu Personalization</h2>
