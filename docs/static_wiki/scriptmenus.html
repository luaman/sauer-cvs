<h2 id="toc0">Menu configuration and personalization</h2>
For example the menu structure is compeletly organized in data/menus.cfg,<br />
so - providing a backup of a working copy - you can edit it to fit your needs.<br />
If you think that is too much of a hassle, then there are several menu translations and ScriptPAKs that further modify your menu on <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.quadropolis.us" rel="nofollow">quadropolis</a>.<br />
<br />
<hr />
<br />
The respective commands for menu construction are:<br />
<br />

<pre><code>newmenu N</code></pre>

Creates a new menu with name N. All following menuitem commands will apply to this menu<br />
<br />

<pre><code>menuitem N A
menuitem A</code></pre>

Creates a new menuitem with description N and action A. if you only specify 1, then it will be used for both the description and the action. See data/menus.cfg for examples. If N starts with the special character &quot;^&quot;, then the name will be evaluated as a command when being displayed, and the the variable &quot;s&quot; used as name. This allows you to create menu items that depend on changing gamestate.<br />
<br />

<pre><code>showmenu N</code></pre>

Displays the menu with name N previously defined, and allows the user to pick an item with the cursor keys. Upon pressing return, the associated action will be executed. pressing ESC will cancel the menu.<br />
