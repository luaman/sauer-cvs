<h1 id="toc0">Introduction</h1>
<br />
Editing in Sauer is very intuitive, yet extremely powerful. There are a multitude of options for editing, and it is impossible to create a complete walkthrough of <strong>everything</strong> you can do with sauer. Thus, experimentation is not only encouraged, to some degree it is required. Even the developers don't know everything that can be done with Sauer - there are many possibilities to be discovered and thought of. As such, this guide will focus on the abstract concepts of editing, and will introduce you to some of the possibilities. For a more concrete (but far from complete) list on the specifics of editing, see the page on <a class="wiki_link" href="Editing%20Methods.html">Editing Methodology</a>.<br />

<h1 id="toc1">Map CFGs</h1>
<br />
Each map's individual properties are determined by its .CFG file. You can find examples in existing .CFG files (just open them up in a text editor), or you can look <a class="wiki_link" href="mapcfg.html">here</a> for the specific commands, and their uses. It is recommended that every map uses a .CFG, since many things are controlled by the .CFG. There is a default .CFG that will be used, if one is not provided. To use a map-specific .CFG, just name the .CFG the same as your map file name.<br />
