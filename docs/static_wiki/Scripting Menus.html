The games menus are completely organized in data/menus.cfg.<br />
Providing yourself with a backup of a working copy - you can edit it to fit your needs.<br />
<br />
If you think that is too much of a hassle, <br />
then there are several menu translations and ScriptPAKs that further modify your menu on <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.quadropolis.us" rel="nofollow">quadropolis</a>.<br />
<br />
Caution : The water-edition (2006-09-12) is the last to use the <em>2D style menus</em>,<br />
the gui-edition (2006-12-04) is the first to use the <em>3D style menus</em>.<br />
Be sure to check your local documentation ... code here might not fit your personal release!<br />
<br />
For a little while these pages will remain in an intermediary state - between 2D and 3D style.<br />
<br />
<hr />
<br />
The respective commands for menu construction are:<br />
<br />

<pre><code>// 2D style:
newmenu N

// 3D style:
newgui S
</code></pre>

Creates a new menu with name N. All following menuitem/gui* commands will apply to this menu<br />
<br />

<pre><code>// 2D style
menuitem N A
menuitem A

// for 3D style check documentation - multiple types available : radio, button, slider, image, text, ...</code></pre>

Creates a new menuitem with description N and action A. if you only specify 1, then it will be used for both the description and the action. See data/menus.cfg for examples. If N starts with the special character &quot;^&quot;, then the name will be evaluated as a command when being displayed, and the the variable &quot;s&quot; used as name. This allows you to create menu items that depend on changing gamestate.<br />
<br />

<pre><code>// 2D style
showmenu N

// 3D style
showgui N
// error in documentation :
showgui servers
// not &quot;showservermenu&quot; as the docs still say from 2D times :-P</code></pre>

Displays the menu with name N previously defined, and allows the user to pick an item with the cursor keys. Upon pressing return, the associated action will be executed. pressing ESC will cancel the menu.<br />

To show you how easy things can be done : some examples (2D style only ATM!)<br />

</ul>

<br />

<ul>
    <li>sure you can switch your team by menu,</li>
</ul>

  but what about more options? What about switching between complete identities?<br />

<br />

<ul>
    <li>An even less elaborate example,</li>
</ul>

  If you're annoyed at &quot;e&quot; toggling editmode just about every time you get hectic during a game ...<br />
  ... then try out something like this :<br />
