Things you can change that either affect your performance or your visual quality, in order of importance:<br />
<br />

<ol>
    <li>Your resolution has the largest effect on performance. Change it in the .bat or .sh file in the main folder (the -w and -h options, try 640 480 for example). If you get bad FPS, taking this down will have immediate effects.</li>
    <li>Shaders: unless you have the latest and greatest card, shaders will hurt your fps. Turn them off by adding the flag -f0 to your commandline. Note that if your card doesn't support them, they will be turned off automatically already</li>
    <li>Antialiasing: -a4 will look fantastic, especially at the lower resolutions, but for max performance should be left at the default -a0</li>
    <li>Full screen shaders: do not turn full screen shaders like bloom on (in the menu) unless you have one of the latest cards.</li>
    <li>Turn off vertical sync (in the driver options) for slightly less hickup in FPS (at the cost of potential visual tearing)</li>
    <li>Colour Depth: Changing to -b16 (16 bits per pixel) can give you quite a performance boost on older hardware. If you use -b16 , be sure to use -z24 too. (24bit depth buffer wonÂ´t hurt your performance, but setting it to 16 will lead to bad visuals, flickering lines and sparks mostly.) Most graphics card automatically change to 16bit depth buffering when using 16-bit colour depth, so make sure you use -z24 to prevent this.</li>
</ol>
