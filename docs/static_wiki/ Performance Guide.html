Things you can change that either affect your performance or your visual quality, in order of importance:<br />
<br />

<ol>
    <li>Resolution: Your resolution has the largest effect on performance. Change it in the .bat or .sh file in the main folder (the -w and -h options, try 640 480 for example). If you get bad FPS, taking this down will have immediate effects.</li>
    <li>Shaders: unless you have the latest and greatest card, shaders will hurt your fps. Turn them off by adding the flag -f0 to your commandline, or if you want to keep them on, use -f1 to use the fastest shader support that your driver offers. Note that if your card doesn't support them, they will be turned off automatically already. You can also selectively turn off some shaders by setting the &quot;shaderdetail&quot; console variable with values 0 through 3 (i.e. &quot;/shaderdetail 1&quot;), with lower values meaning fewer fancy visual effects. Using the -f1 command-line option and a low &quot;shaderdetail&quot; value together can make shaders perform quite well on low end cards.</li>
    <li>Antialiasing: -a4 will look fantastic, especially at the lower resolutions, but for max performance should be left at the default -a0.</li>
    <li>Fullscreen Shaders: do not turn full screen shaders like bloom on (in the menu) unless you have one of the latest cards.</li>
    <li>VSync: Turn off vertical sync (in the driver options) for slightly less hickup in FPS (at the cost of potential visual tearing)</li>
    <li>Colour Depth: Changing to -b16 (16 bits per pixel) can give you quite a performance boost on older hardware. If you use -b16 , be sure to use -z24 too. (24bit depth buffer wonÂ´t hurt your performance, but setting it to 16 will lead to bad visuals, flickering lines and sparks mostly.) Most graphics card automatically change to 16bit depth buffering when using 16-bit colour depth, so make sure you use -z24 to prevent this.</li>
    <li>Water: If water is slowing you down, at least turn off refraction (blurring of stuff under the water) with &quot;/waterrefract 0&quot;. If that's still not enough, turn off reflections with &quot;/waterreflect 0&quot; as well (it may look ugly, though).</li>
</ol>
