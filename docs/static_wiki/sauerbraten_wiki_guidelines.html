<h1 id="toc0">Sauerbraten Wiki Guidelines</h1>
<br />
<h2 id="toc1">Usage</h2>
<br />
From Aardappels <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://cubeengine.com/forum.php4?action=display_thread&amp;thread_id=939&amp;start=20" rel="nofollow">post</a> on the <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://cubeengine.com/forum.php4" rel="nofollow">cube forum</a>.<br />

<tt>&quot;Do not be afraid to refactor things. Sofar it seems people just ADD to the wiki, and leave what is there in place. One of the ideas behind a wiki is that its easy to reorganize the soup of data. If you add something that makes the structure of the document less than ideal, do not be afraid to restructure other peoples text into a different set of pages and links. Do not be afraid to even delete other people's text, once you conclude it has become redundant. The original structure was just me making some example pages, it may not be ideal for the current contents anymore.<br />
<br />
Feel free to discuss in this thread if you have major restructurings in mind, or certain conventions.<br />
<br />
Don't let pages grow to huge amounts of text, wiki's are best when they are small sections of text per page, but HEAVILY linked.<br />
<br />
In that same way, one of the goals of the wiki is to function as a FAQ, so if we get the 1001th post on &quot;your server did not reply to ping&quot; we can point people to exactly one wiki page that has all the firewall tutorials you could ever wish for.<br />
<br />
Some stuff on the wiki is straight out of the main documentation. Duplication is not good, it means if I update the main documentation the wiki instantly contains outdated information. Since the wiki is more for FAQ/tutorial kinda stuff, and the docs more for hardcore factual reference, it is good to have each section of the wiki refer to pages in the docs where the exact command reference related to the topic can be found.<br />
<br />
If you know of topics that have been discussed on this forum before, it is really helpfull to find these threads, and make a wikipage out of the most explanatory posts. Infact, maybe I should be typing this post in the wiki rather than on the forum, it is getting rather long... :)<br />
<br />
If additional people want editing access, apply for it on the wiki page.<br />
<br />
I will make sure it is linked from the various web pages soon, that should ensure more traffic.&quot;</tt><br />

<h2 id="toc2">drian's formatting suggestion</h2>
<br />
To ensure a common text formatting on this wiki, we all should follow some basic rules. My suggestion:<br />
<br />

<ul>
    <li>Code/script listings but also one-liners in a reference should be <a href="http://www.wikispaces.com/wikitext+code" rel="nofollow">formatted as code</a>.</li>
    <li>In-text code like variables should be <em>italicized</em>.</li>
    <li>Directory path's and filenames should be <em>italicized</em>.</li>
    <li>Quotes and sauerbraten shell output should be formatted with the <tt>Monospaced Font</tt>. If possible, link to the original source.</li>
    <li>Do not use horizontal lines to separate text, use headings.</li>
    <li>Use the <strong>bold</strong> and <u>underlined</u> stuff sparingly. It should be used to highlight important information; do not use it to differ some text from the rest, that's what <em>italics</em> is for.</li>
</ul>
