<h2 id="toc0"><a name="prepreq"></a>preparations/requirements</h2>
When you decide to try out Sauerbraten you should be aware of your operating system, your current graphics chipset (manufacturer and card name) and that this project is still &quot;Work in Progress&quot;!<br />
<br />
Due to <strong>platform dependencies</strong> some stuff works differently depending on your O/S (operating system).<br />
For example on linux users can dynamically change their screen resolution, on Win32 this isn't possible.<br />
<br />
If you are running linux you should be sure that you have set up your system sufficiently to play,<br />
running &quot;glxgears -info&quot; can help and having other OpenGL and/or SDL based applications already working is a solid basis to encourage you to proceed here.<br />
<br />
Be prepared that some <strong>graphics cards</strong> have problems running with the default configuration.<br />
You should then try to use all toggles to reduce rendering complexity and work yourself up.<br />
Some example combinations:<br />

<ul>
    <li>[max. compatibility] : -w640 -h480 -b8 -z8 -a0 -f</li>
    <li>[nVidia bpp/z-buffer] : -w1024 -h768 -b16 -z24 -a1 -f1</li>
    <li>[full fledged] : -f3 -a4 -b24 -z24 -w1600 -h1200</li>
</ul>

<br />
<h2 id="toc1"><a name="progstart"></a>system setup</h2>
First try running the game out-of-the-box,<br />
but in the long run you will want to optimize your setup to your hardware and personal preferences.<br />
There is a <a class="wiki_link" href="Performance%20Guide.html">plethora of settings</a> for you to do this.<br />
RTFM : <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://sauerbraten.org/docs/config.html" rel="nofollow">config page</a><br />
<br />
To run with these parameters call your systems shell script with them.<br />

<ul>
    <li>on *nix : usage as usual for you.</li>
</ul>

Maybe you'd like to use <a class="wiki_link" href="Linux%20Server%20Scripts.html">some shell scripts</a> to handle <em>sauerbraten_unix</em> for you,<br />
switching between different setups made easy,<br />
random start map selection. <br />
<br />

<ul>
    <li>on Windows : In case your in doubt : copy your sauerbraten.bat to sauerbraten_myconf.bat and edit with notepad/wordpad/equivalent</li>
</ul>


<pre><code>@ECHO OFF
REM -- default call
REM bin\sauerbraten.exe -w1024 -h768 %1 %2 %3 %4 %5
REM -- full fledged call
REM bin\sauerbraten.exe -w1600 -h1200 -b24 -z24 -a4 -f3 %1 %2 %3 %4 %5
REM -- minimalistic call
REM bin\sauerbraten.exe -w800 -h600 -b8 -z16 -a0 -f -lpindakaas
REM -- my call
bin\sauerbraten.exe -w800 -h600 -b8 -z16 -a0 -f -lpindakaas</code></pre>

Later you might want to change the last line to your systems optimal settings.<br />
It often pays to not have any settings in sauerbraten.bat itself.<br />
Instead you could just call<br />

<pre><code>bin\sauerbraten.exe %1 %2 %3 %4 %5</code></pre>

and add appropriate parameters to a range of links (*.lnk) - say on your Desktop -<br />
like &quot;Medium-Resolution Sauer&quot;, &quot;minimal sauer&quot;, &quot;EyeCandy&quot;, ...<br />
<br />

<ul>
    <li>on Mac : [..TODO..] There's supposedly a launcher for sauerbraten, details unknown [..TODO..]</li>
</ul>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<h2 id="toc2"><a name="download"></a>download walk-through</h2>
Click on the <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=102911" rel="nofollow">appropriate download link</a> and select your mirror to download the installation file.<br />
Currently official clients exist for Win32, *Nix and OS X.<br />
Pick a local mirror.<br />
<br />
<h2 id="toc3"><a name="unpacking"></a>unpacking</h2>

<ul>
    <li>There is an installer wrapper for <strong>Win32</strong>, execute and follow the well known set of dialogs.</li>
    <li>On <strong>*Nix</strong> untar to your favourite location (say /usr/local/sauerbraten), chmod the binaries +x if required.</li>
    <li><strong>Mac OS</strong> : [..TODO..] but should be pretty straight forward  [..TODO..]</li>
</ul>

<br />
<h2 id="toc4"><a name="autoexec"></a>basic configuration</h2>
Manage your configuration via the &quot;<strong>autoexec.cfg</strong>&quot;.<br />
If the file does not exist in your base installation folder then create it.<br />
Two lines are a bare minimum:<br />

<pre><code>name &quot;GameName&quot;
team &quot;Team&quot;</code></pre>

<br />
name is capped off at 15 characters, team at 4.<br />
<br />
The autoexec.cfg is executed once upon start of the engine.<br />
Then the engine looks for <strong>config.cfg</strong> and either executes this, if found, or recreates one from data/defaults.cfg.<br />
This is important to know in case of the game suddenly being stubborn about something. The symptom usually is something like a keybinding (that used to work) no longer being functional - in such cases : <em>quit the game, remove config.cfg (rename/delete) and restart the engine.</em><br />
<br />
For a more complex setup you might like to try the <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://quadropolis.us/node/263" rel="nofollow">meATpAk [0.6x</a>], which gives you more elaborate menus, a keyboard layout switcher and loads of scripts to use as gamer, mapper or scripter.<br />
<br />
<h2 id="toc5"><a name="firstrun"></a>first run</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Win32 : run the sauerbraten.bat</li>
    <li>*Nix : run the ./sauerbraten_unix script from the base installation folder</li>
    <li>OS X : TODO</li>
</ul>

There are some external docs till this wiki contains those infos too :<br />

<br />
<a name="introSP"></a><br />
<h2 id="toc6">a look at SP</h2>
The SinglePlayer (SP) modes of Sauerbraten enable you to play offline against a range of monsters.<br />
Start your SP game via the menu or set your mode and an appropriate map by hand.<br />
Beware that the so-called <tt>Episode 1</tt> does not currently contain monsters. It is still WiP!<br />
The single maps for basic SP (<tt>mode -2</tt>) <em>do have</em> monsters, though;<br />
and you can play (almost) any map in DMSP (<tt>mode -1</tt>) against a horde of monsters matching your <tt>skill</tt> level.<br />
<br />
In the basic SP mode (<tt>mode -2</tt>) which works more or less like in every other FPS - <br />
you can pick up items only once and monsters stay killed;<br />
progress is controlled with respawn-points. <br />
Touching a respawn-point will set your next spawn to that location.<br />
If you get fragged by the monsters you will respawn inside the map, <br />
having lost all armour and some ammo, ...<br />
...but at least your previous incarnation has cleared the way a little.<br />
Your score is calculated as seconds you took to complete the map. <br />
Deaths, monsters left, accuracy, and a basic modifier for skill setting all get taken into account.<br />
<br />
The SP DeathMatch mode (DMSP (<tt>mode -1</tt>)) will work on any map - but some just won't cut it - <br />
and will pit you against a number of monsters (10x skill) spawning at random points. <br />
If you die in this mode the ordeal repeats - either you beat the horde or you don't - it's a DeathMatch!<br />
<br />
<h2 id="toc7"><a name="introMP"></a>a look at MP</h2>
The integrated server browser is available via the multiplayer menu, be sure to regularly update from master server.<br />
The list is sorted by ping for your convenience.<br />
A &quot;<strong>P</strong>&quot; next to the number of players indicates a <strong>private server</strong> and &quot;<strong>L</strong>&quot; stands for <strong>locked server</strong>. <br />
(see <a class="wiki_link" href="Multiplayer%20Guide.html#master">mastermodes section</a>)<br />
<br />
<h2 id="toc8"><a name="introRPG"></a>a look at RPG</h2>
This is still <em>very much</em> WiP!<br />
You can have a look at what's cooking by running with a -grpg parameter included.<br />
So far only some NPC models are visible and the action menu is visible and ready for use,<br />
only the actions simply output their name and don't really do anything yet. Stay tuned for further progress ...<br />
<br />
<h2 id="toc9"><a name="help-yourself"></a>help on finding help</h2>
While getting to know a new piece of software it is often the case that you might need help with an aspect you (personally) don't find intuitive.<br />
This is perfectly natural and nothing to be ashamed of,<br />
but the way you go about <em>asking for help</em> can be! So here's some help on getting help:<br />
First off - as always - the hint to RTFM (read the fine manual), it seems impossible to stress this hard enough,<br />
since we've had incredible amounts of requests for help by people who obviously didn't read the manual and could have saved everybody (including themselves) some time if they had.<br />
<br />
Your local manual is accessible via the README.html in your installation folder;<br />
the documentation is also available from <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://sauerbraten.org/README.html" rel="nofollow">sauerbraten.org</a>.<br />
<br />
The game is pretty straight-forward to jump into so some people seem to overlook the manual - don't make that mistake yourself!<br />
<br />
Another suggestion is to read the following article about <em>asking smart questions</em>,<br />
it's not associated with this project but is a general article about how to go about getting help on the interwebs.<br />
Do not contact the authors about Cube/Sauerbraten/Eisenstern - they're only trying to help you find help (in general), not for this project specifically.<br />

<br />
The next step for you would be to contact the community of this project;<br />
either by posting in the <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://cubeengine.com/forum.php4" rel="nofollow">cube forum</a> <br />
or by visiting the IRC-Channel #sauerbraten on irc.quakenet.org.<br />
<br />
Good luck!
