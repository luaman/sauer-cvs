Unique to the Cube engines , Coop Edit lets you build and modify maps with others seamlessly.<br />
This &quot;game mode&quot; just allows you to switch to the edit mode online , at the cost of some missing functions.<br />
For instance , you can't undo any change. It would not make sense when several people modify the same cubes.<br />
Map changes are visible to all connected players , but joining in the middle of a coopedit section may be confusing , you could find yourself playing on the previous version of a map. To save your progress , type /sendmap to upload the current map to the server and others can use /getmap to edit and play on the same version. You can't undo changes , but you can revert the map back to its previous state on your site by downloading it from the server again.<br />
<br />
Lighting is disabled by default on coopedit (fullbright on) so that you are not left in the dark when starting a new map. It is possible to enable it again and recalculate lighting , but this is a client-side calculation , only you will see the map lit properly. Still , lights and other entities are saved with the map when you upload it.<br />
<br />
Remember that you and other players have absolute control over the map , this is cooperative editing - you can add to other's work or remove it. It is poor form to delete or &quot;overwrite&quot; other's work without their consent , just like it wasn't nice to destroy the other kid's castle in the sandbox. Coop editors try to not work next to each other to avoid interference.<br />
<br />
Coopediting can speed up repetitive or boring processes especially for large and complicated maps , like smoothing lots of curves or building long stairways. Other editors can fix errors that you didn't notice with a method you didn't know about. It is important in coopedit to share editing techniques , so that even newbies can help you out. Think of editing Cube maps as writing wiki articles : anyone can contribute , and even if suffering some damage (inflicted deliberately or not) it can be easily reverted back to a normal state.
