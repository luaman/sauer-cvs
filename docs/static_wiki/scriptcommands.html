<h1 id="toc0">Command Reference</h1>
<br />
The following is an excerpt of commands available to you for scripting,<br />
refer to your local documentation to find out all commands available.<br />
On this page you will find commands and examples of usage to help get you into CubeScript.<br />
Almost all commands can be used in scripting, noteable exceptions include <tt>watersubdiv</tt> and <tt>waterlod</tt>.<br />
You can't override them - a message will be output to your console in such cases.<br />
<br />

<br />

<pre><code>exec C</code></pre>

Executes all commands in config file C.<br />
<br />

<pre><code>history N</code></pre>

Executes the Nth command in the command line history. For example, binding &quot;history 0&quot; to a key allows you to quickly repeat the last command typed in (useful for placing many identical entities etc.)<br />
<br />

<pre><code>saycommand P...</code></pre>

This puts a prompt on screen where you can type stuff into, which will capture all keystrokes until you press return (or esc to cancel). You may press tab to autocomplete commands/aliases/variables, and up/down keys to browse the command history. If what you typed started with a &quot;/&quot;, the rest of it will be executed as a command, otherwise its something you &quot;say&quot; to all players. default key = T for talk, ` for commands. If P is prefix to insert to the buffer, (default key ` inserts a /).<br />
<br />
The following example will prepare one of three messages to be output via <tt>say</tt>, but don't be fooled, you can execute anything else besides <tt>say</tt> with this too.<br />

<pre><code>// TO COME</code></pre>

<br />

<pre><code>weapon a b c</code></pre>

Tries to select weapons a, b &amp; c, in that order, if they have ammo ( 0 = fist, 1 = sg, 2 = cg, 3 = rl, 4 = rifle, 5 = gl ). If none of the 3 indicated have any ammo, it will try the remaining weapons for one with ammo (in order 3/2/1/4/0) (the fist needs no ammo). You can use the weapon command with 0 to 3 arguments. examples:<br />
<br />
weapon 2 1 0 <em>close up selection<br />
weapon 4 3 2</em> far away selection<br />
weapon 3 2 1 <em>medium distance selection<br />
weapon 0</em> humiliate selection :)<br />
weapon // just switch to anything with ammo<br />
<br />
In any selection, it will skip whichever weapon you have currently selected, so executing a weapon command repeatedly toggles between the two best weapons with ammo within a given selection. default keys 0 to 4 select the corresponding weapons, with sensible default alternatives, middle mouse button is a simple weapon switch.<br />
<br />

<pre><code>alias N A
N = A</code></pre>

Binds name N to commands A, after which you can use N as a shortcut for A. You may re-bind N as often as you like, call it recursively etc. You may use N = A as a shortcut for alias.<br />
<br />

<pre><code>forward
backward
left
right</code></pre>

Move you in said direction (defaults to cursor keys).<br />
<br />

<pre><code>attack</code></pre>

Fires the current weapon. default = left mouse<br />
<br />

<pre><code>jump</code></pre>

Triggers a jump. default key space &amp; right mouse.<br />
<br />

<pre><code>fov N</code></pre>

Sets your FOV to 10..150.<br />
<br />

<pre><code>setfullscreenshader Name</code></pre>

Sets your favourite fullscreen shader. Active permanently once set. Use without name argument to turn it off. Current example shaders: invert, gbr, sobel, bloom<br />
<br />

<pre><code>screenshot</code></pre>

Writes out &quot;screenshotN.bmp&quot;, where N is the number of milliseconds since cube was launched (default key = F12).<br />
<br />

<pre><code>hidehud b</code></pre>

Turns on/off the entire hud display, which includes rendering stats, ammo, and echoed text. (default = 0)<br />
<br />

<pre><code>crosshairsize n</code></pre>

Sets the size of your crosshair, 0 being off (default = 3)<br />
<br />

<pre><code>keymap K N A</code></pre>

<br />
Sets up the keymap for key code K with name N and default action A. You should never have to use this command manually, use &quot;bind&quot; instead.
