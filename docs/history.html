        <h2>[old history]</h2>
        <pre>
May 22 2005:
----------------
- 101 small changes to bring all the old cube functionality back up and running,
  mostly affecting gameplay &amp; rendering. Singleplayer and Multiplayer mostlty work again.

May 21 2005:
----------------
- lots of updates to lightmaps, and related stuff
- prune micro cubes in editing
- limit texture selection

May 17 2005:
----------------
- raycube changed to support lightmaps better

May 16 2005:
----------------
- inital lightmap code added

May 15 2005:
----------------
- added a cube validator that's called after a map is loaded.
- added a ray casting function in preperation for lighting. Using it to get editing cursor for now.
- added some collision detection / response against entities. they still get stuck...

May 8 2005:
----------------
- collision detection / response is now functionally done.
- cleaned up editing a bit.

May 6 2005:
----------------
- remip functionally done. will want to clean it up a bit though.

Apr 24 2005:
----------------
- more tweaks to remip

Apr 23 2005:
----------------
- remip. still need to integrate it with editing commands.

Apr 22 2005:
----------------
- added reorient command.
- changed collision detection. Now player treated as rectangle. Much simpler and faster.
  still need to find proper floorheight
- Collision clipping planes added to cube structure. Are generated at same time as vertexes are.
  (currently static arrays, though will probably allocate dynamically in future to save mem)
- also a few other minor changes to subdivision etc, since no need for gentris().

Feb 2 2005:
----------------
- fixed dropped geometries in octarender (#58)

Jan 24 2005:
----------------
- simplifyied the rendering and partial update code
- rearranged the hud map numbers abit, added allocated vertex array counter "va"

Jan 18 2005:
----------------
- fixed crash due to failed to clear va pointer

Jan 9 2005:
----------------
- changed cvec into ivec (integers instead of uchar)
- changed most integer points into ivec
- fixed cursor position depth for small gridsizes
- added error msg to newmap when not in editmode
- started to clean up some stuff

Jan 4 2005:
----------------
- make _DEBUG gcc friendly

Jan 3 2005:
----------------
- fixed memory leak (vertex array not destroyed)
- force all children in selection area to update

Dec 31 2004:
----------------
- fixed GL_ARB_vertex_buffer_object function pointer dereference when extension not present

Dec 19 2004:
----------------
- revision 1.12 of the exe has a new command "fixmap", that can be entered through the console. this will convert older maps that had problems because of recent updates. it acts as a toggle. "fixmap" will not be a part of future exe s, and I haven't bothered putting it in the source code.

Dec 18 2004:
----------------
- fixed partial update bug, now calls addchanged() after octree is changed
- perfoemance improvement for partial updates
- added partial updates

Dec 13 2004:
----------------
- more work on ramp collision and response (very smooth now)
- fixed bug #15

Dec 12 2004:
----------------
- rework vertex array code to better fit model
- GNU g++ compatibility in physics.cpp
- add framework for partial map updates

Dec 11 2004:
----------------
- fixed up ramp collision

Dec 8 2004:
----------------
- added VBO support
- fixed possible memory leak
- removed VAR code

Dec 6 2004:
----------------
- make tools.h more compatible with gcc
- comment out VAR code
- improved hidden face rejection
- added hierarchial vertex arrays
- added view frustrum culling
- updated included glext.h to latest from SGI

----------------
- fixed edgeinv creating invalid cubes
- fixed grid being changable while dragging
- fixed #2, #3
- added selection support to cube hud counter
- misc cleanup in octaedit
- made tools.h more compatible with gnu c++, based on somebody's (D.plomat?, Thailon?) mingw cube source.
- added subdivision special cases. still need to add slightly stronger condition for 'peeling'

Nov 30 2004:
----------------
- tiny bug fixes, like #8 and selgrid init
- selection support for rotation
- changed edge configuration. simplifies flip and rotate, while everything else should be unaffected.

Nov 28 2004:
----------------
- real gravity (but too much air friction)

Nov 27 2004:
----------------
- starting to refactor some things like subdivision (but need to fix special cases), RCD, loopsel, gentris etc
- made bounding box react more elliptical... though still need to fix physics/collision stuff with z dimension like changing gravity to a velocity.

Sept 8 2004:
----------------
- added stairs support
- added jumping

July 29 2004:
----------------
- fixed player starting inside the ground when newmap
- took out the newworld function
- cubes are now always convex (well except for some very rare special cases)
- added collision detection for ellipsoid players. step response is only partial finished.

May 21 2004:
----------------
- added red 0 reference box
- added selection support to copy and paste
- added selection support to undo
- added selection support to flip

May 19 2004:
----------------
- tweaked cursor depth
- added 3D selection
- added selection support to fill command
- added selection support to edittex
- made undo more conservative

May 15 2004:
----------------
- fixed subdivision happening in cursorupdate, cube stat
- fixed subdivisions 'peeling' and 'cracking' to a decent degree
- changed fill command to no longer fill cube when scrolling down
- added selection functionality to fill command
- added ad-hoc vertex lighting editing
- more rearrangement of faceverts.
- added fixfaces to fix old maps that are displayed differently because of faceverts changes (remove after next release)
- finished empty_world / newmap
- updated menu.cfg, autoexec

May 11 2004:
----------------
- added cube stat to hud

May 09 2004:
----------------
- rearranged faceverts in octarender, which removed the need for some hacks

May 06 2004:
----------------

- added geomip (though not inverse)
- added cubic copy and paste
- added cubic flip and 90 degree rotate
- added undo (doesn't work with selections fully )
- added texture edit
- changed pitch/yaw derived selection to cubic boundary face selection
- cleaned up octaedit
- hacked a fix for a culling error in touchingfaces
