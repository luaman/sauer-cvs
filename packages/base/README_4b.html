<h1>Sauerbraten MapPack :: 4b :: Four Bases</h1>

<p>
The background of this campaign is your basic FPS-SinglePlayer-Plot:<br />
The evil <b>Ithaqua</b> (see <a href="http://www.cthulhu.org/cthulhu/" target="_blank">Cthulu</a>) has to be stopped!<br />
Fight yourself through his defences and eliminate all resistance.<br />
Our intelligence shows he is currently taking the form of Bauul and is hiding his true self in <i>Escher Space</i>,<br />
any and all Bauuls you might encounter and/or eliminate outside of that strange and warped section of space-time will not really kill him.<br />
But it will weaken him - so destroy all his minions and alter-egos you encounter on your way;<br />
speaking openly - we do know he has a habit of keeping unassailable spy minions inside some of his bases,<br />
so you might have to accept the occasional <u>one</u> left behind.<br />

<p>These are some hints ... if you find yourself stumped.<br />
Read on at your own risk,<br />
they might <i>spoil your fun</i> at finding stuff out for yourself!<br />

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0">
<tr> <th>Map</th> <th>Title</th> <th>Helper</th> </tr>
<tr> <td>1</td> <td><b>I</b>thaqua's <b>D</b>epot</td> <td>You can't enter the first room again after teleporting, pick your first teleport with care!</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>2</td> <td><b>D</b>efense <b>Q</b>uarters</td> <td>The first problem will be finding a terminal to hack.<br />Be sure to explore all the map and try to find access to areas otherwise not open - like for example by not using a door, but rather a window or some ledge...<br />The other aspect that might have you stumped is to really kill <u>all</u> the monsters.<br />You can <i>see</i> them all ... but not all are readily accesible,<br />learn to use your arsenal of weapons to adapt to given situations and reach hard to get-at minions of Ithaqua.</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>3</td> <td><b>D</b>istraction</td> <td>If you've walked everywhere and can't seem to find where to continue - look again,<br />there's a whole section that only opens up after you've dealt with other obstacles of this base.</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>4</td> <td><i>Escher Space</i></td> <td>Don't let Ithaqua's weirding way confuse you,<br /><i>Escher Space</i> is a heavly incurled region of space-time.<br />Be prepared to retrace your steps but keep on a constant look-out - Ithaqua is known to spring enemies on you in areas you might expect to be clean of his minions already.<br />We know for a fact that the entry-point to <i>Escher Space</i> is some form of nexus, where he himself is most likely to be found; whenever possible return there to do another sweep of his non-euclidean domain. He's hiding there, somewhere.</td> </tr>
