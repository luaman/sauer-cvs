****************************************

A remake of the most famous Classic Quake 1v1 map of the FPS history, released 10 years and some months ago...

:: version 1.0, released in September 2006

:: installation: unzip into your Sauerbraten\packages\base folder

:: 2 player DM is strongly recommended

:: minor changes according to the original map:
 - the 150 armor has been replaced with riflerounds
 - the yellow armor room is lowered so you can get back to the center with a rifle jump :)
 - added an extra health pack near the teleport on the top floor
 - 1 rocket pack instead of 3 on the first floor
 
:: built in 4 days using Sauerbraten editor and watching the original map's layout in Qoole, a Quake map editor
