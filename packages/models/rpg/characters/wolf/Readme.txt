The makkewolf came about after the famous artist makkE_ was warned not to go behind door #3.
  He was bitten by a werewolf and now is living out his lycanthropic existence inside Sauerbraten.  Remember kids, don't go behind door #3 unless you want to be a werewolf.

Special thankyou to makkE_, Aardrappel, eirhul and drian for their guidance.

MakkeWolf was modeled and animated in Blender v2.41.
