1. Selection
===============

Sauerbraten uses a form of 3D selection. Editing commands will only affect the selected cubes.

There are two modes of selection: implicit and explicit. 

All you have to do to implicitly select a cube is point at it as if to shoot it. A white 2D box will 
highlight the cube you are currently selecting.

In order to explicitly select a block of cubes, just point and left click on a cube. If you hold down 
the left mouse buttong, you can select many cubes. It should be just like selecting files in windows, 
but in 3D. Explicit selections override implicit ones.

As you explicitly select cubes, a blue 3D box will outline the cubes that you have selected. Also a 
white 2D box and grid will appear on one side of the selection. If you move the scroll wheel, all 
the corners of a selected cube that are inside this white box will be pushed in, or pulled out, 
deforming the cubes. You might also notice a red box that highlights one of the corners of the 
selection box. This is used as a reference as it always surrounds the same corner. 

If you want to quickly change the side the white selection box appears on without relselecting, 
press the right mouse button when pointing at the new side you want, on any cube. This cube 
does not actually have be in the selection.

2. Commands
===============

The commands below can be entered in the console (press '~'), or better yet, bound to keys. 
Some of these commands have parameters that need to be used.

Parameters:
N - integer
D - direction (1 or -1)
X - name

gridpower N
-----------
changes the size of the grid 

reorient
-----------
change the side the white box is on to be the same as where you are currently pointing.

editface D N
-----------
main editing command. 
N=0	push corners in white box
N=1	fill or empty cubes
N=2	push corner you're pointing at

flip 
-----------
flip the selected cubes front to back relative to the side of the white box.

rotate D
-----------
rotates the selection 90 degrees around the side of the white box. This side must be 
square in order for it to work, so the selection will change automatically to fit if it's not.

copy
-----------
copies the selection.

paste
-----------
pastes the copied selection. if the current selection is not the same size as the copy, 
the corner of the red reference box will be used as the origin. If the current gridsize is 
changed from the copy, the pasted copy will be stretched by the same factor.

edittex D
-----------
Cycles through a list of textures on the same side as the white box.

undo
-----------
pressing 'Z' will undo your last edit move.

undomegs N
-----------
sets the amount of megs allocated for undos. 

editmat X 
-----------
changes the empty space material of the cube.
If the cube is partially or fully empty, then empty space will be filled with the material.
This changes the physics and appearance of the space in various ways.
Currently supported materials:
  air - the default material for all cubes
  water - shows water waves at the top surface of the cube
  clip - cubes are always treated as entirely solid in physics

watersubdiv N
--------------
waves the water at 2^N unit intervals.

waterlod N
-----------
increases the local water subdiv by 1 for every 32*2^N units the player is away from
the water's edge.

entdrop N
-----------
variable controlling where entities created with "newent" will be placed.
N=0     place entities at your current eye position.
N=1     drop entities to the floor beneath you. 
        Lights, however, will be placed at your current eye position as for N=0.
N=2     place entities at the center of the currently selected cube face.
        If a corner is selected, the entity will be placed at the corner vertex.
N=3     behaves as with N=2, except all entities, including lights, will then be
        dropped from that position to whatever floor lies beneath. This mode is
        useful for placing objects on selected floors. Lights are also dropped
        to the floor, unlike for N=1.

dropent
---------
positions the closest entity according to the entdrop variable. 


selextend
---------
extend current selection to include cursor


===============
3. HUD stats
===============

On the bottom right of the screen are a bunch of stats. You'll find out what they mean below.

cube
--------
the number of cubes in the current selection. Only the visible (leaf) cubes are counted.

fps
--------
frames per second

ond
--------
number of cubes in the system. This includes parent cubes, copied cubes, and undos.

va
--------
number of vertex arrays used to store vertecies in the map. you probably don't need to use this.

vtr
--------
number of triangles currently being displayed. will be a useful stat when culling is done.

vvt
--------
number of vertecies currently being displayed. again, useful when culling is done.

tri
--------
number of triangles in the entire map

wvt
--------
number of vertecies in the entire map

evt
--------
misc rendering effects. stuff like particles displayed, or text written on screen.

4. Tips
===============

In general, just like CUBE, the larger the cubes you use the better the performance and 
memory use you get. So always try to use the largest cubes possible that will give you 
the detail you need.

gridsize matters. when using a command, if you use a gridsize smaller then that of the 
selected cube, that cube will split into eight or more smaller cubes. this is also known as 
subdivision, and is similar to carving in quake. 

subdivision only makes a "best effort" at replicating the original cube using the smaller 
cubes... it is not something you should be relying on.
