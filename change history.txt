- real gravity (but too much air friction)

Nov 27 2004:
----------------
- starting to refactor some things like subdivision (but need to fix special cases), RCD, loopsel, gentris etc
- made bounding box react more elliptical... though still need to fix physics/collision stuff with z dimension like changing gravity to a velocity.

----------------
- added stairs support
- added jumping

July 29 2004:
----------------
- fixed player starting inside the ground when newmap
- took out the newworld function
