History of changes:

Dec 18 2004:
----------------
- perfoemance improvement for partial updates
- added partial updates

Dec 13 2004:
----------------
- more work on ramp collision and response (very smooth now)
- fixed bug #15

Dec 12 2004:
----------------
- rework vertex array code to better fit model
- GNU g++ compatibility in physics.cpp
- add framework for partial map updates

Dec 11 2004:
----------------
- fixed up ramp collision

Dec 8 2004:
----------------
- added VBO support
- fixed possible memory leak
- removed VAR code

Dec 6 2004:
----------------
- make tools.h more compatible with gcc
- comment out VAR code
- improved hidden face rejection
- added hierarchial vertex arrays
- added view frustrum culling
- updated included glext.h to latest from SGI

Dec 4 2004:
----------------
- fixed edgeinv creating invalid cubes
- fixed grid being changable while dragging
- fixed #2, #3
- added selection support to cube hud counter
- misc cleanup in octaedit
- made tools.h more compatible with gnu c++, based on somebody's (D.plomat?, Thailon?) mingw cube source.
- added subdivision special cases. still need to add slightly stronger condition for 'peeling'

Nov 30 2004:
----------------
- tiny bug fixes, like #8 and selgrid init
- selection support for rotation 
- changed edge configuration. simplifies flip and rotate, while everything else should be unaffected.

Nov 28 2004:
----------------
- real gravity (but too much air friction)

Nov 27 2004:
----------------
- starting to refactor some things like subdivision (but need to fix special cases), RCD, loopsel, gentris etc
- made bounding box react more elliptical... though still need to fix physics/collision stuff with z dimension like changing gravity to a velocity.

Sept 8 2004:
----------------
- added stairs support
- added jumping

July 29 2004:
----------------
- fixed player starting inside the ground when newmap
- took out the newworld function
- cubes are now always convex (well except for some very rare special cases)
- added collision detection for ellipsoid players. step response is only partial finished.

May 21 2004:
----------------
- added red 0 reference box
- added selection support to copy and paste
- added selection support to undo
- added selection support to flip

May 19 2004:
----------------
- tweaked cursor depth
- added 3D selection
- added selection support to fill command
- added selection support to edittex
- made undo more conservative

May 15 2004:
----------------
- fixed subdivision happening in cursorupdate, cube stat
- fixed subdivisions 'peeling' and 'cracking' to a decent degree
- changed fill command to no longer fill cube when scrolling down 
- added selection functionality to fill command
- added ad-hoc vertex lighting editing
- more rearrangement of faceverts. 
- added fixfaces to fix old maps that are displayed differently because of faceverts changes (remove after next release)
- finished empty_world / newmap
- updated menu.cfg, autoexec

May 11 2004:
----------------
- added cube stat to hud

May 09 2004:
----------------
- rearranged faceverts in octarender, which removed the need for some hacks

May 06 2004:
----------------

- added geomip (though not inverse)
- added cubic copy and paste
- added cubic flip and 90 degree rotate
- added undo (doesn't work with selections fully )
- added texture edit
- changed pitch/yaw derived selection to cubic boundary face selection
- cleaned up octaedit
- hacked a fix for a culling error in touchingfaces
