		<div>License</div>
		<p>The Sauerbraten game is freeware, you may freely distribute the 
		Sauerbraten archive/installer <em>unmodified</em> on any media. You may re-compress using different archival formats suitable for your OS (i.e. zip/tgz/rpm/deb/dmg), any changes beyond that require my explicit permission.</p>
		<p>You may play Sauerbraten for any purpose as long as you 
	    don't blame me for any damages incurred.</p>
		<p>
        If you want to produce new content with the sauerbraten engine, you have to be aware
        that the source code may be Open Source, but the game and the media it consist of
        have their individual licenses and copyrights. This means that you have roughly
        3 options:
        <ul>

        <li>
    
        You may produce new content for the sauerbraten game, for example as a &quot;custom map&quot; (.ogz/.cfg/textures etc). Contributing to the original game is most welcome,
        and the most productive way of working with sauerbraten.
            <li>
                If you want to create your own gameplay beyond what you can do with a map, the best
                way to do this is as a &quot;mod&quot; (same as above, but with new executable that
                incorporates your gameplay), that <em>requires an existing install of sauerbraten</em>,
                and <em>installs only the new files</em> you created in parallel to the existing files.
            <li>

                If you insist on making a standalone game based on sauerbraten, do realize that 
                <em>only the sourcecode</em>
            is
                yours to use freely (if you abide by the ZLIB license, see below), not the media.
                You CANNOT simply redistribute the entire sauerbraten package with your modified
                files, as the majority of game media is not yours to use freely (it is made by many
            authors with a variety of licences and copyright restrictions). Unless you have
                explicit permission from the authors, or the readme says explicitly "may be used
                for any purpose" or similar language, it will be illegal to include in your standalone
                game based on the sauerbraten engine (you may not assume that just because a file
            has no explicit license, that it is free of copyright). Therefore, if you wish to produce a standalone
                game, be prepared to make many of the maps, models, textures, sounds etc from scratch
                yourself.</ul>
        <p>
            In this sense sauerbraten is similar to games like Quake (its code is Open Source,
            but its media is not), it is a game that is meant
            to be added to, not copied and used as a template. Sauerbraten is not meant to be a quick game
            creation kit, it is a game.</p>
		<p>If you wish to use the Sauerbraten 
		  source code (ZLIB license) in any way, read the src/readme_source.txt file carefully.</p></body>
