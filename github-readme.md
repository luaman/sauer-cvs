=========

This repo contains the early development history of the Sauerbraten engine. (2004-2009) 

It was pulled from sauerbraten.cvs.sourceforge.net years ago, I don't know if the server even exists anymore!

**NOTE:** versions before [this one](https://github.com/luaman/sauer-cvs/commit/cd5a4e03d3749b5aa3db9fc6793646ff3f13ac05) expect to be located in `C:\w\sauerbraten` at compile time

So enjoy, I guess.
