=========

This repo contains the early development history of the Sauerbraten game engine. (2004-2008)

It was pulled from sauerbraten.cvs.sourceforge.net years ago.



**NOTE:** versions before [this one](https://github.com/luaman/sauer-cvs/commit/cd5a4e03d3749b5aa3db9fc6793646ff3f13ac05) expect to be located in `C:\w\sauerbraten` at compile time
