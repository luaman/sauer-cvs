implementation plan (roughly in order of importance to make the game playable):

- pain & attack sounds
- add icons for most items - show current item & quick bar on hud
- simple way of tracking quests, both log and progress variables
- implement npcs getting hostile if you pick up anything in the world within N range, or M sightrange
  the more worth the item, the longer they will be hostile. if they knock you out, they'll take the item back.
- move more stuff from c++ to script
- hud weapons?
- make some game messages into centerprints?
- implement attackspeed/movespeed/jumpheight and other stats
- game loading/saving
- work on animations (attack etc)
- make generic box that can take icons to replace generic bag
- add many more standard items, maybe some temp more monsters from the fps
- tweak all stats
- improved grid layout inventory screens
- horse riding (maybe at first as teleport, later as fast transport)
- FIXME's in code
- do world pickups differently (not with gui window), show worth stat while hovering over
  maybe generally do system with different crosshairs depending on what you point at (take, attack)

art list:
- hud with health mana stat bars
  * health and mana
  * current weapon icon
  * 12 slots for quick use items
  * small radar
  * info line for mouse over?
- icons:
  * buy
  * sell
- hud weapons: fist / sword (maybe axe and others) / bow or crossbow / shotgun? / spell casting hands
