gilt:
- LOD: improved lod-remip
- other tools that are geared towards easier editing of heightfields/terrain/rocks
- "editing not in view" sometimes obstructs editing

eihrul:
- map up/download etc
- water physics close to surface
- implement variable LM sampling
- optimize overdraw in visibleface()
- add a spotlight (ask me)
- shadows for mapmodels
- texture replacement

aard:
- remove wiki for now
- see if a workaround for th 8x.xx texture bugs is possible -> with shaders this would also go away
- go do quick phong lighting for models
- make 3rd person weapons show... how to make an axe swing rather than go back and forth?
- update web page | new screenshots | make description less technical (move to docs), present sauer as a freeware GAME, not as an engine (make clear only engine is OS). | change cube page to point people more clearly to sauer
- make sauer inner directory
- iconic stats
- remove player name when dead
- new BAS sounds?
- make very clear section in the docs about what you can and cannot do with sauer
- powerup announce | make both powerups not spawn on map start / not be in sync
- per sound volume
- grenade launcher | bouncing gib particles
- make health/armour/quad be available clientside, then add em to player floating text | team diff colour?
- new multiplayer model.. md3?
- keybinds per mode: editing/game
- make ents better visible?
- player spawn sound
- make wether you are hitting other player clearer - blip sounds like q3?
- hex numbers
- add hidden ID to your name so that you can claim nicknames on a server?
- can join a server in edit mode
- edit textures when extruding
- show quadded player with special rendering
- experiment with physics speedup features
- think about simpler area based portals / combine with doors | automatically? compute portals of each VA? REALLY need some culling for monsters/items etc
- make remip part of savemap or calclight?
- poly iterator for the model formats
- think of cheap way to have surface normals available.. can do tangent/bin globally? keep it all in worldspace? lights?
can do bumpmapping by simply having an "average tangentspace lightvector" LM and a "occlusion and attenuation color" LM,
then no list of lights and no tangent space vectors would be needed! superior to dot3 lightmaps really?
big problem is how to get a tangent space eye vector for spec?? 
to get accurate spec, we need per vertex sub, which can only ever be worldspace. best we can do is global TS.
-> do some tests to see what current state sorting amounts to, and what would happen if you'd swap
- draw not-spawned items in wireframe?
- make start of flares etc spawn out further from the player
- importcube takes insane amounts of memory on larger maps... needs progress bar, and mapsize independent of source map
- better attack anim? with weapon maybe | add vwep?
- check why texture stretching on certain recent nvidia drivers only happens for certain textures -> looks like its caused by async copying of the S/T vectors
- triggers/doors for SP
- switch to tri lists instead of quad lists, and do manual triangulation to make surface bulge only -> also for physics
- optimize drawing of water & glass
- spectator mode
- profile rpg_01
- select entities in parallel to geometry by picking | make editing more readable
- skybox - roll
- 3rd person view seems to really slow fps on some systems still... | plan to have mapmodels and other entities as part of octanodes?
- LOD: visibleface(lodcube==true) must not go across VA boundaries... otherwise minor HOM bewteen LOD/non-LOD rendering boundaries
- LOD: materials & sky currently always rendered at lod0 only, is that ever a problem visually/performance?
- LOD: make loddistance fov dependent (for models too)
- cube loader: import some sample cube maps | metl3
- all cfg stuff in menu
- a multiplayer player still shows SG rays go thru target | hard to fix, is it really a problem?
- new mapmodels/trees in menu -> new ones from last cube
- better damage particles
- players more visible / improve model lighting first?
- HDR
- start using md3 for new monsters/player models
- revise health/armours? can either make armours more effective against certain weapons (feedback?)
  or do more general properties (do more damage, run faster)
- find more sensible solution for wiki / work on better sauer web page
- mp objectives
- 2 teams only
- sound samples for N kills in a row | accuracy stats
- sword?
- sounds | matt?
  * impact (diff materials + flesh)
  * flyby, both instant & projectile
  * soundspot / moving
- improve on cma render then add to sauer
- slowmo?
- VBO verts are 24 bytes, remove the next ptr, make UVs shorts or bytes? make coords shorts?
- voice during multiplayer?
- give players identity to combat cheating by coupling to something like Steam?

- fix the two //BREAK

- move some of the gameplay serverside
- bf mode
- start with rpg mode | clientside only, simplify

- system that does a calclight/savemap automatically for maps with no lighting, and and easy way to prune lighting information for release
- calclight while playing?

- more gameplay refactoring
- cube map loader
- new cube models -> sauer

- use of glBufferData() makes ATI driver crash on SDL_Exit()
- gui framework
- test errors / performance etc with devpartner
- (E) <nieb> with vsync off i get the normal 4cube jump height but with it on i can jump almost 10cubes
- (E) fix VFC entities
- (E) mapobjects (trees!) must cast shadows, have lightorientation
- some way to smooth out lighting on terrain
- (EG) physics efficiency: tweak step accuracy, maybe reduce physics frames at low fps?
- (EG) fix polygons being rendered on top of eachother
  * quick fix: rotate indices of quads that produce coplanar tris
  * better fix: generate exact faces (subdivided if need be) for faces touching neighbouring cubes
- fix variance in framerate?
- (EG) landscape generation and tools (see wiki)
- (E) improve visibleface() to not render some polys inside solids anymore (overdraw!)
- (E) reduce geometry by merging surfaces and lightmaps
- shader system
- LOD on VA's
- render entities at distance as sprites
- try out hardware occlusion queries before portals
- (E) sort the order of rendering mapmodels, so as to factor out glbindbuffer
- SP: add pistol ammo box... make monster use it? hmmm not more hitscan
- switch to new fmod api & 3d sound? not available for bsd? openal?

- blend screen when inside a cube

    p/p     sel
0   face    aligned 4
1   cube    aligned 4
2   vert    unal 1
3   conn    unal 4
4   edge    unal 2
