gilt:
- LOD: improved lod-remip
- "editing not in view" sometimes obstructs editing

eihrul:
- map up/download etc
- water physics close to surface
- add a spotlight (ask me)
- very fancy: test alpha on a polygon for ultra-quality raycube()
- improve smoothness of going up steps
- sound entities
- reduce geometry by merging surfaces and lightmaps
- add entity looping command?

aard (e = eihrul (or gilt) could do it):
- kurts weird geometry bug: http://www.fidnet.com/~kesler/screenshot_486017.jpg
- report to ATI: float vs short issue
- font black outlines
- kurt map bases above eachother
- more mapmodels in the menus
- texture lists (g_pack etc) / remove 256 limit
- allow specifying more textures per slot
- new SP respawn system
- play sessions
- rpg design doc
- spec maps
- doors that work nicely with OC?
- add PITCH to specular computation
- update web page | new screenshots | make description less technical (move to docs), present sauer as a freeware GAME, not as an engine (make clear only engine is OS). | change cube page to point people more clearly to sauer
- can't select last 3 textures in list
- powerup announce | make both powerups not spawn on map start / not be in sync
- (e) bouncing gib particles
- (e) set textures when extruding
- water shader
- monster spawner ammo - add egg model
- iconic stats
- new BAS sounds?
- (e) new multiplayer model.. md3?
- (e) keybinds per mode: editing/game
- player spawn sound
- profile for memory usage (devpartner?) | if md2 buffers are a lot, can remove it
- refactor octarender.cpp & others
- make sure correct CVS files are flagged as binary? | switch to SVN?

- fix polygons being rendered on top of eachother
  * quick fix: rotate indices of quads that produce coplanar tris
  * better fix: generate exact faces (subdivided if need be) for faces touching neighbouring cubes
  -> switch to tri lists instead of quad lists, and do manual triangulation to make surface bulge only -> also for physics

- start with rpg mode | clientside only, simplify

- make start of flares etc spawn out further from the player
- fix the two //BREAK : sp intermission | sp savegames
- improve on cma render then add to sauer
- new sounds: impact (diff materials + flesh) | flyby, both instant & projectile | soundspot / moving
- start using md3 for new monsters/player models
- fullscreen shader | bloom

- better damage particles
- new mapmodels/trees in menu -> new ones from last cube
- all cfg stuff in menu
- skybox - roll
- draw not-spawned items in wireframe?
- show quadded player with special rendering

- (e) hex numbers
- 3d menus
- add hidden ID to your name so that you can claim nicknames on a server?

- experiment with physics speedup features

- make 3rd person weapons show... how to make an axe swing rather than go back and forth?
- better attack anim? with weapon maybe | add vwep?

- triggers/doors for SP
- think about simpler area based portals / combine with doors | automatically? compute portals of each VA? REALLY need some culling for monsters/items etc

- find efficient solution for normals on world geometry, first just to compute smoother lighting, then for tangent space?
- think of cheap way to have surface normals available.. can do tangent/bin globally? keep it all in worldspace? lights?
  can do bumpmapping by simply having an "average tangentspace lightvector" LM and a "occlusion and attenuation color" LM,
  then no list of lights and no tangent space vectors would be needed! superior to dot3 lightmaps really?
  big problem is how to get a tangent space eye vector for spec?? 
  to get accurate spec, we need per vertex sub, which can only ever be worldspace. best we can do is global TS.
  -> do some tests to see what current state sorting amounts to, and what would happen if you'd swap

- make health/armour/quad be available clientside, then add em to player floating text | team diff colour?
- make wether you are hitting other player clearer - blip sounds like q3?
- importcube takes insane amounts of memory on larger maps... needs progress bar, and mapsize independent of source map
- select entities in parallel to geometry by picking | make editing more readable
- 3rd person view seems to really slow fps on some systems still...
- LOD: visibleface(lodcube==true) must not go across VA boundaries... otherwise minor HOM bewteen LOD/non-LOD rendering boundaries
- LOD: materials & sky currently always rendered at lod0 only, is that ever a problem visually/performance?
- LOD: make loddistance fov dependent (for models too)
- a multiplayer player still shows SG rays go thru target | hard to fix, is it really a problem?
- players more visible?
- 2 teams only
- sound samples for N kills in a row | accuracy stats
- sword?
- think about doing other permanent powerups besides +10h
- slowmo as gameplay feature?
- voice during multiplayer? -> easier to use ventrillo
- give players identity to combat cheating by coupling to something like Steam?
- system that does a calclight/savemap automatically for maps with no lighting, and and easy way to prune lighting information for release
- calclight while playing?
- use of glBufferData() makes ATI driver crash on SDL_Exit()
- gui framework
- test errors / performance etc with devpartner
- fix variance in framerate?
- landscape generation and tools (see wiki)
- render entities at distance as sprites
- sort the order of rendering mapmodels, so as to factor out glbindbuffer
- SP: add pistol ammo box... make monster use it? hmmm not more hitscan
- switch to new fmod api & 3d sound? not available for bsd? openal?
- blend screen when inside a cube
