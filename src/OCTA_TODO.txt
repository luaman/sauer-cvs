gilt:
- LOD: improved lod-remip
- other tools that are geared towards easier editing of heightfields/terrain/rocks
- "editing not in view" sometimes obstructs editing

eihrul:
- map up/download etc
- water optimisation
- water physics close to surface
- implement variable LM sampling
- optimize overdraw in visibleface()
- add a spotlight (ask me)

aard:
- map rotation
- teamskins / teamplay hud?
- kurts first map floor one level? | jump to quad on two towers | new rpg map?
- get disconnected whenever someone else disconnects?
- tone down knockback of all weapons
- make ents better visible?
- pressed return on an empty list
- stop movement in intermission
- player spawn sound
- make wether you are hitting other player clearer - blip sounds like q3?
- hex numbers
- make roll configurable?
- can join a server in edit mode
- should not jump if key is released before landing
- edit textures when extruding

- new sounds!
- experiment with physics speedup features
- look at vsync/tripple buf/fps limits/fsaa
- set newly touched cubes in edit mode to fullbright light + textures of visible part
- think about simpler area based portals / combine with doors | automatically? compute portals of each VA?
- make remip part of savemap?
- poly iterator for the model formats

- perma powerup / powerup announce
- draw not-spawned items in wireframe?
- green damage numbers?
- make start of flares etc spawn out further from the player
- hellpig sometimes goes invisble?
- importcube takes insane amounts of memory on larger maps... needs progress bar, and mapsize independent of source map
- allow people to look different in-game
- better attack anim? with weapon maybe
- check why texture stretching on certain recent nvidia drivers only happens for certain textures -> looks like its caused by async copying of the S/T vectors
- triggers/doors for SP
- switch to tri lists instead of quad lists, and do manual triangulation to make surface bulge only -> also for physics
- optimize drawing of water & glass
- spectator mode
- profile rpg_01
- select entities in parallel to geometry by picking | make editing more readable
- compression of octa info into indexes (e.g. textures into shorts?)
- skybox - roll
- 3rd person view seems to really slow fps on some systems still... | plan to have mapmodels and other entities as part of octanodes?
- LOD: visibleface(lodcube==true) must not go across VA boundaries... otherwise minor HOM bewteen LOD/non-LOD rendering boundaries
- LOD: materials & sky currently always rendered at lod0 only, is that ever a problem visually/performance?
- LOD: make loddistance fov dependent (for models too)
- make sauer inner directory
- cube loader: import some sample cube maps | metl3
- all cfg stuff in menu
- a multiplayer player still shows SG rays go thru target
- new mapmodels/trees in menu -> new ones from last cube
- damage more visible | gib fountains | anything that gives better feedback
  smoke & dirt pieces on impact
- physics left/right
- players more visible / improve model lighting first?
- HDR
- start using md3 for new monsters/player models
- revise health/armours? can either make armours more effective against certain weapons (feedback?)
  or do more general properties (do more damage, run faster)
- GL? / grapple? /
- find more sensible solution for wiki / work on better sauer web page
- mp objectives
- 2 teams only
- sound samples for N kills in a row | accuracy stats
- sword?
- sounds | matt?
  * impact (diff materials + flesh)
  * flyby, both instant & projectile
  * soundspot / moving
- improve on cma render then add to sauer
- slowmo?
- VBO verts are 24 bytes, remove the next ptr, make UVs shorts or bytes? make coords shorts?
- voice during multiplayer?
- give players identity to combat cheating by coupling to something like Steam?

- fix the two //BREAK

- move some of the gameplay serverside
- bf mode
- start with rpg mode | clientside only, simplify

- system that does a calclight/savemap automatically for maps with no lighting, and and easy way to prune lighting information for release
- calclight while playing?

- more gameplay refactoring
- cube map loader
- new cube models -> sauer

- use of glBufferData() makes ATI driver crash on SDL_Exit()
- gui framework
- test errors / performance etc with devpartner
- (E) <nieb> with vsync off i get the normal 4cube jump height but with it on i can jump almost 10cubes
- (E) fix VFC entities
- (E) mapobjects (trees!) must cast shadows, have lightorientation
- some way to smooth out lighting on terrain
- (EG) physics efficiency: tweak step accuracy, maybe reduce physics frames at low fps?
- (EG) fix polygons being rendered on top of eachother
  * quick fix: rotate indices of quads that produce coplanar tris
  * better fix: generate exact faces (subdivided if need be) for faces touching neighbouring cubes
- fix variance in framerate?
- (EG) landscape generation and tools (see wiki)
- (E) improve visibleface() to not render some polys inside solids anymore (overdraw!)
- (E) reduce geometry by merging surfaces and lightmaps
- shader system
- LOD on VA's
- render entities at distance as sprites
- try out hardware occlusion queries before portals
- (E) sort the order of rendering mapmodels, so as to factor out glbindbuffer
- SP: add pistol ammo box... make monster use it? hmmm not more hitscan
- switch to new fmod api & 3d sound? not available for bsd? openal?

- blend screen when inside a cube

    p/p     sel
0   face    aligned 4
1   cube    aligned 4
2   vert    unal 1
3   conn    unal 4
4   edge    unal 2
