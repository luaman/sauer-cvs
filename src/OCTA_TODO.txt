- make menus work when game is paused

- make sure all bumpmaps are parallax -> finetune each one individually

- audio effect for chat messages | audio for gui events
- texture selection window using new GUI

- social cheating solution

- before a release: update static wiki

- improve smoothness of going up steps ?
- remove delay before doors start opening ?
- make nearby closed doors render early so that they can contribute to OC?
- when printing "base N captured" etc, look up value of alias basename_N, and substitute if found
- water physics close to surface
- sound entities
- add entity looping command?

- LOD: improved lod-remip?
- "editing not in view" sometimes obstructs editing

- maybe add a way to purge infrequent / not recently used textures? esp now with mapshots.

- reduce maps
- memory leaks?
- Mix_LoadMUS() crashes after being called many times?

- death needs to be more obvious (better sound/centerprint) 
- sparklies very bad on ATI, particularly deathtek / diff skybox
- crashes when people join?
- ensure modelshader can be set from model cfg
- 2 levels of lightlod for huge maps
- shallow water splashing sound?

- use setbb also for monsters
- experiment with averaging lightvector based on intensity^N, such that dominant light becomes more dominant without losing smooth transitions | store intensity multiplier in alpha?

- the eyecandy priority list: reflective world shader, autograss/vegetation, better bloom, motion blur, volumetric fog, character shadows, better particles, character bumpmaps...
- bots (level design placed waypoints?)
- destructable geom

- better doc on the scripting language | beginners guide | wiki?
- fake rigid-body sphere only?
- $ vs @? var stacks? [] for trees/arrays? other improvements? | do "." for concatword so you could do easy (associative) arrays and tree structures?
- start moving some stuff in their own headers
- new BAS sounds? | player spawn | sp respawn | menu clicks | specific door sound? | end of level | push button/trigger
- improve bloom? optimize it.
- report to ATI: float vs short issue
- more cube map ports?
- faster movement
- integrate fmodex (to get both panning and stereo ogg on windows?)
- 3d sprites?
- monster spawner ammo - add egg model
- iconic stats
- new multiplayer model.. md3?
- profile for memory usage (devpartner?) | if md2 buffers are a lot, can remove it
- refactor octarender.cpp & others
- glowmaps in the texture browser -> messy

- better blood http://www.snieb.com/dg_blood_01.png (and 2/3)

- make start of flares etc spawn out further from the player
- improve on cma render then add to sauer
- new sounds: impact (diff materials + flesh) | flyby, both instant & projectile | soundspot / moving

- all cfg stuff in menu
- draw not-spawned items in wireframe?
- show quadded player with special rendering

- experiment with physics speedup features

- make wether you are hitting other player clearer - blip sounds like q3?
- LOD: visibleface(lodcube==true) must not go across VA boundaries... otherwise minor HOM bewteen LOD/non-LOD rendering boundaries
- LOD: materials & sky currently always rendered at lod0 only, is that ever a problem visually/performance?
- LOD: make loddistance fov dependent (for models too)
- a multiplayer player still shows SG rays go thru target | hard to fix, is it really a problem?
- 2 teams only
- sound samples for N kills in a row
- sword?
- think about doing other permanent powerups besides +10h
- slowmo as gameplay feature?
- calclight while playing?
- use of glBufferData() makes ATI driver crash on SDL_Exit()
- fix variance in framerate?
- render entities at distance as sprites
- blend screen when inside a cube
