- fix 3rd person camera
- limited range ambient light command
- fix skybox rendering when world is bigger than fog distance
- fix physics
- fix holes on subdivision (Gilt)
- fix polygons being rendered on top of eachother
  * quick fix: rotate indices of quads that produce coplanar tris
  * better fix: generate exact faces (subdivided if need be) for faces touching neighbouring cubes
- coop editing: simply send new editing commands over the network as with cube
- fix variance in framerate?
- factor out gamecode


- larger selections
- connected push
- copy & paste
- texturing
- push side edge
- more precise picking
- face based selection
- somehow lock edit ops in timeframe to a particular cube?
- unlimited undo
- blend screen when inside a cube
- better geommip
- better inverse geomip
- better display of editing: show corners that are influenced by operation etc.
- rotate & flip
- fix entintmap -> physics problem, also shows when going editmode -> normal outside of octree
- improve visibleface()
