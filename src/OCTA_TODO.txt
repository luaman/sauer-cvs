gilt:
- LOD: improved lod-remip
- other tools that are geared towards easier editing of heightfields/terrain/rocks
- "editing not in view" sometimes obstructs editing

eihrul:
- map up/download etc
- water physics close to surface
- implement variable LM sampling
- optimize overdraw in visibleface()
- add a spotlight (ask me)
- optimize per-poly raycube() by creating a bounding-sphere tree cache
- very fancy: test alpha on a polygon for ultra-quality raycube()
- improve smoothness of going up steps
- sound entities

aard (e = eihrul (or gilt) could do it):
- figure out why binaries get corrupted | switch to SVN?
- add PITCH to specular computation
- add entity looping command?
- update web page | new screenshots | make description less technical (move to docs), present sauer as a freeware GAME, not as an engine (make clear only engine is OS). | change cube page to point people more clearly to sauer
- can't select last 3 textures in list
- powerup announce | make both powerups not spawn on map start / not be in sync
- (e) bouncing gib particles
- finish up grenade launcher (skin? doc?)
- test capture mode more...
- (e) set textures when extruding
- (e) triggers/doors for SP
- optimize model shader
- water shader
- monster spawner ammo
- find efficient solution for normals on world geometry
- (e) make 3rd person weapons show... how to make an axe swing rather than go back and forth?
- iconic stats
- new BAS sounds?
- (e) make health/armour/quad be available clientside, then add em to player floating text | team diff colour?
- (e) new multiplayer model.. md3?
- (e) keybinds per mode: editing/game
- player spawn sound
- make wether you are hitting other player clearer - blip sounds like q3?
- (e) hex numbers
- 3d menus
- add hidden ID to your name so that you can claim nicknames on a server?
- show quadded player with special rendering
- experiment with physics speedup features
- think about simpler area based portals / combine with doors | automatically? compute portals of each VA? REALLY need some culling for monsters/items etc
- think of cheap way to have surface normals available.. can do tangent/bin globally? keep it all in worldspace? lights?
can do bumpmapping by simply having an "average tangentspace lightvector" LM and a "occlusion and attenuation color" LM,
then no list of lights and no tangent space vectors would be needed! superior to dot3 lightmaps really?
big problem is how to get a tangent space eye vector for spec?? 
to get accurate spec, we need per vertex sub, which can only ever be worldspace. best we can do is global TS.
-> do some tests to see what current state sorting amounts to, and what would happen if you'd swap
- draw not-spawned items in wireframe?
- make start of flares etc spawn out further from the player
- importcube takes insane amounts of memory on larger maps... needs progress bar, and mapsize independent of source map
- (e) better attack anim? with weapon maybe | add vwep?
- switch to tri lists instead of quad lists, and do manual triangulation to make surface bulge only -> also for physics
- select entities in parallel to geometry by picking | make editing more readable
- (e) skybox - roll
- 3rd person view seems to really slow fps on some systems still... | plan to have mapmodels and other entities as part of octanodes?
- LOD: visibleface(lodcube==true) must not go across VA boundaries... otherwise minor HOM bewteen LOD/non-LOD rendering boundaries
- LOD: materials & sky currently always rendered at lod0 only, is that ever a problem visually/performance?
- LOD: make loddistance fov dependent (for models too)
- cube loader: import some sample cube maps | metl3
- all cfg stuff in menu
- a multiplayer player still shows SG rays go thru target | hard to fix, is it really a problem?
- new mapmodels/trees in menu -> new ones from last cube
- better damage particles
- players more visible / improve model lighting first?
- HDR
- start using md3 for new monsters/player models
- mp objectives
- 2 teams only
- sound samples for N kills in a row | accuracy stats
- sword?
- think about doing other permanent powerups besides +10h
- sounds | matt?
  * impact (diff materials + flesh)
  * flyby, both instant & projectile
  * soundspot / moving
- improve on cma render then add to sauer
- slowmo?
- VBO verts are 24 bytes, remove the next ptr, make UVs shorts or bytes? make coords shorts?
- voice during multiplayer? -> easier to use ventrillo
- give players identity to combat cheating by coupling to something like Steam?

- fix the two //BREAK

- start with rpg mode | clientside only, simplify

- system that does a calclight/savemap automatically for maps with no lighting, and and easy way to prune lighting information for release
- calclight while playing?

- new cube models -> sauer

- use of glBufferData() makes ATI driver crash on SDL_Exit()
- gui framework
- test errors / performance etc with devpartner
- (E) fix VFC entities
- some way to smooth out lighting on terrain
- (EG) fix polygons being rendered on top of eachother
  * quick fix: rotate indices of quads that produce coplanar tris
  * better fix: generate exact faces (subdivided if need be) for faces touching neighbouring cubes
- fix variance in framerate?
- (EG) landscape generation and tools (see wiki)
- (E) improve visibleface() to not render some polys inside solids anymore (overdraw!)
- (E) reduce geometry by merging surfaces and lightmaps
- render entities at distance as sprites
- try out hardware occlusion queries before portals
- (E) sort the order of rendering mapmodels, so as to factor out glbindbuffer
- SP: add pistol ammo box... make monster use it? hmmm not more hitscan
- switch to new fmod api & 3d sound? not available for bsd? openal?

- blend screen when inside a cube

    p/p     sel
0   face    aligned 4
1   cube    aligned 4
2   vert    unal 1
3   conn    unal 4
4   edge    unal 2
