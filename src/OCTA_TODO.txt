gilt:
- speed up heightfield recalc
- LOD: improved lod-remip
- "editing not in view" sometimes obstructs editing

eihrul:
- shadow bugs on demomap?
- shader docs
- improve smoothness of going up steps
- remove delay before doors start opening
- better collision on doors (and maybe any rotated object, while we're at it).
- automatically not spawn ammo on capture maps so that they can be shared with dm maps -> ask nieb to change his maps
- make nearby closed doors render early so that they can contribute to OC?
- when printing "base N captured" etc, look up value of alias basename_N, and substitute if found
- water at the edges never waves?
- map up/download etc
- water physics close to surface
- add a spotlight (ask me)
- very fancy: test alpha on a polygon for ultra-quality raycube()
- sound entities
- reduce geometry by merging surfaces and lightmaps
- add entity looping command?
- figure a way to make setting per texture params less expensive
  * limit the set per shader: only allow the shader ones to be set: wrap the defaults in at start

aard/everyone:
- maybe add a way to purge infrequent / not recently used textures? esp now with mapshots.
- finish debris
- border gfx & tabs for ui
- before next release: calclight all maps

- social cheating solution
- reduce maps
- memory leaks?

- before release: update static wiki
- Mix_LoadMUS() crashes after being called many times?
- get 22khz version of "base lost"

- add parallax scaling parameter

- new textures: philipk / gregor

- debris particles (makke?)
- get kurt to fix decal textures

- death needs to be more obvious (better sound/centerprint) 
- screenshots etc? new features in docs
- specmap thats not same size as diffuse crash
- sparklies very bad on ATI, particularly deathtek / diff skybox
- audio effect for chat messages
- crashes when people join?
- bake normalmap on -f0? mildly?
- clean up maps folder | maps without lightmaps?
- ensure modelshader can be set from model cfg
- 2 levels of lightlod for huge maps
- shallow water splashing sound?

- weird fps issue.. maybe mobile?
- auto bounding boxes that can be overridden
- use setbb also for monsters
- experiment with averaging lightvector based on intensity^N, such that dominant light becomes more dominant without losing smooth transitions | store intensity multiplier in alpha?
- create an official map pack to reduce on the number of maps in the distribution
- pitch on hudgun specular
- the eyecandy priority list: reflective world shader | better bloom, motion blur, volumetric fog, character shadows, better particles, character bumpmaps? auto grass/vegetation...
- better doc on the scripting language | beginners guide | wiki?
- new menu / for rpg and fps
- spec/normal trilinear filtering? -> probably because of specmap mipmap averaging... luns specmaps are simply too subtle
- fake rigid-body sphere only?
- $ vs @? var stacks? [] for trees/arrays? other improvements? 
- start moving some stuff in their own headers
- rpg start
- new BAS sounds? | player spawn | sp respawn | menu clicks | specific door sound? | end of level | push button/trigger
- improve bloom? optimize it.
- scripting: do "." for concatword so you could do easy (associative) arrays and tree structures?
- report to ATI: float vs short issue
- more cube map ports?
- faster movement
- play sessions
- integrate fmodex (to get both panning and stereo ogg on windows?)
- 3d sprites?
- think about ways to make dynamicly modifying geometry in gameplay make sense
- can't select last 3 textures in list
- monster spawner ammo - add egg model
- iconic stats
- new multiplayer model.. md3?
- profile for memory usage (devpartner?) | if md2 buffers are a lot, can remove it
- refactor octarender.cpp & others
- glowmaps in the texture browser -> messy

- ways to reduce server bandwidth in multiplayer
  * reduce client packets from 30 to 20 per second  -> choppier movement of other players?
  * (DONE) make server batch position updates for multiple clients to lose packet overhead (UDP 8 + enet 16) -> introduce lag, but could save up to 50% bw with 5 players
  * update positions less often for clients at distance/occluded
  * mix absolute and delta packets depending on the amount of packet loss
    * better than delta, can send just move/strafe/mousedelta for 3 out of 4 packets or so... needs improved physics prediction
  * all the above could be scaled to get more intense with gradually higher player loads

- fix polygons being rendered on top of eachother
  * quick fix: rotate indices of quads that produce coplanar tris
  * better fix: generate exact faces (subdivided if need be) for faces touching neighbouring cubes

- make start of flares etc spawn out further from the player
- improve on cma render then add to sauer
- new sounds: impact (diff materials + flesh) | flyby, both instant & projectile | soundspot / moving

- better damage particles
- new mapmodels/trees in menu -> new ones from last cube
- all cfg stuff in menu
- skybox - roll
- draw not-spawned items in wireframe?
- show quadded player with special rendering

- hex numbers
- 3d menus
- add hidden ID to your name so that you can claim nicknames on a server?

- experiment with physics speedup features

- make 3rd person weapons show... how to make an axe swing rather than go back and forth?
- better attack anim? with weapon maybe | add vwep?

- make wether you are hitting other player clearer - blip sounds like q3?
- importcube takes insane amounts of memory on larger maps... needs progress bar, and mapsize independent of source map
- LOD: visibleface(lodcube==true) must not go across VA boundaries... otherwise minor HOM bewteen LOD/non-LOD rendering boundaries
- LOD: materials & sky currently always rendered at lod0 only, is that ever a problem visually/performance?
- LOD: make loddistance fov dependent (for models too)
- a multiplayer player still shows SG rays go thru target | hard to fix, is it really a problem?
- 2 teams only
- sound samples for N kills in a row
- sword?
- think about doing other permanent powerups besides +10h
- slowmo as gameplay feature?
- voice during multiplayer? -> easier to use ventrillo
- give players identity to combat cheating by coupling to something like Steam?
- system that does a calclight/savemap automatically for maps with no lighting, and and easy way to prune lighting information for release
- calclight while playing?
- use of glBufferData() makes ATI driver crash on SDL_Exit()
- test errors / performance etc with devpartner
- fix variance in framerate?
- render entities at distance as sprites
- sort the order of rendering mapmodels, so as to factor out glbindbuffer
- blend screen when inside a cube
