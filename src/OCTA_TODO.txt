gilt:

eihrul:
- physics dynamics that feel like cube
- implement variable LM sampling
- optimize overdraw in visibleface()
- physics bugs (goes back to jump split second after landing, and whatever else)
- an RGB that is stored as part of the map, and that is set as the color value for all water

aard:
- cube loader: dropent doesn't work again, ents only available after reload | import some sample cube maps
- check connect/disconnect: possible to only half connect, or connect and have a ghost
- add http://oss.sgi.com/projects/ogl-sample/registry/EXT/wgl_multisample.txt
- all cfg stuff in menu
- new mapmodels/trees in menu -> new ones from last cube
- players more visible
- rocketlauncher too weak | check damage in mp | rl bounce | damage numbers
- MG spread | reduce amount of ammo in boxes | max ammo | respawn rates
- damage & bullets particles more visible | flat particle beams | gib fountains | anything that gives better feedback
  long sparks, smoke & dirt pieces on impact
- physics left/right
- HDR
- revise health/armours? can either make armours more effective against certain weapons (feedback?)
  or do more general properties (do more damage, run faster)
- GL? / grapple? /
- mp objectives
- 2 teams only
- sound samples for N kills in a row | accuracy stats
- sword?
- sounds | matt?
  * impact (diff materials + flesh)
  * flyby, both instant & projectile
  * soundspot / moving
- fix ssg rays
- improve on cma render then add to sauer
- slowmo?

- fix the two //BREAK

- finish gameplay seperation
- move some of the gameplay serverside
- bf mode
- start with rpg mode | clientside only, simplify

- system that does a calclight/savemap automatically for maps with no lighting, and and easy way to prune lighting information for release

- more gameplay refactoring
- cube map loader
- new cube models -> sauer

- use of glBufferData() makes ATI driver crash on SDL_Exit()
- gui framework
- test errors / performance etc with devpartner
- (E) <nieb> with vsync off i get the normal 4cube jump height but with it on i can jump almost 10cubes
- (E) fix VFC entities
- (E) mapobjects (trees!) must cast shadows, have lightorientation
- some way to smooth out lighting on terrain
- (EG) physics efficiency: tweak step accuracy, maybe reduce physics frames at low fps?
- (E) fix skybox rendering when world is bigger than fog distance
- fix physics feel
- (EG) fix polygons being rendered on top of eachother
  * quick fix: rotate indices of quads that produce coplanar tris
  * better fix: generate exact faces (subdivided if need be) for faces touching neighbouring cubes
- (EG) coop editing: simply send new editing commands over the network as with cube
- fix variance in framerate?
- (EG) landscape generation and tools (see wiki)
- (E) improve visibleface() to not render some polys inside solids anymore (overdraw!)
- (E) reduce geometry by merging surfaces and lightmaps
- factor out gamecode
- shader system
- (G) make it such that collision uses same quad->2tris subdivision as rendering
- LOD on VA's
- render entities at distance as sprites
- try out hardware occlusion queries before portals
- (E) sort the order of rendering mapmodels, so as to factor out glbindbuffer
- SP: add pistol ammo box... make monster use it? hmmm not more hitscan
- switch to new fmod api & 3d sound? not available for bsd? openal?

- connected push
- blend screen when inside a cube
