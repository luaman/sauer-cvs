- texture rotation
- fix 3rd person camera
- mapobjects (trees!) must cast shadows, have lightorientation
- some way to smooth out lighting on terrain
- allow models to share texture
- limited range ambient light command
- physics efficiency: clip cache, tweak step accuracy, maybe reduce physics frames at low fps?
- fix skybox rendering when world is bigger than fog distance
- fix physics feel
- genclipplanes in physics bogs framerate
- fix polygons being rendered on top of eachother
  * quick fix: rotate indices of quads that produce coplanar tris
  * better fix: generate exact faces (subdivided if need be) for faces touching neighbouring cubes
- coop editing: simply send new editing commands over the network as with cube
- fix variance in framerate?
- landscape generation and tools
- factor out gamecode
- shader system
- try out hardware occlusion queries before portals


- connected push
- blend screen when inside a cube
- improve visibleface()
