sauer-cvs
=========

A (better) clone of the now-dead cube 2 cvs repo

this contains the development history of Cube 2 from 2004-2009,
commits end on page 223

although the cvs server is still up at sauerbraten.cvs.sourceforge.net,
i feel like Sourceforge might discontinue their CVS services as it hasnt been updated in many years

this could be useful if you want to start game development with a teeny tiny low-res engine 
(versions from 2004 are only 4mb!)

so enjoy i guess
