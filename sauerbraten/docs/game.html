                                        this puts a prompt on screen where you can type stuff into, which will capture 
                                        all keystrokes until you press return (or esc to cancel). You may press tab to 
                                        autocomplete commands/aliases/variables, and up/down keys to browse the command 
                                        history. If what you typed started with a "/", the rest of it will be executed 
                                        as a command, otherwise its something you "say" to all players. default key =

                                        <pre><font size=3>    connect serverip     </font></pre>
                                        connects to a server, e.g. "connect fov120.com". There is no serverbrowser nor 
                                        paste yet, so you are adviced to paste ips into a suitable bind into your 
                                        autoexec.cfg for the moment.

                                        <pre><font size=3>    rate N     </font></pre>
                                        sets your clients maximum downstream bandwidth to N bytes per second. Leaving 
                                        it at 0 (the default) means the server will dynamically try to do the best 
                                        thing, this is recommended for players who don't have a clue what their 
                                        bandwidth is (setting your rate unoptimally is worse than not setting it all). 
                                        Modem players (56k)&nbsp;could try rate 4000 and tweak from there, dsl players 
                                        can try rate 6000-10000. Note that the more players on a server, the more 
                                        critical the effect of your rate.
                                        <pre><font size=3>    team teamname     </font></pre>

                                        characters, case sensitive).
                                        <pre><font size=3>    showscores     </font></pre>
                                        +showscores turns display of scores (name/frags/network) on and -showscores 
                                        turns it off. Default key = tab
                                        <pre><font size=3>    conskip N     </font></pre>
                                        allows you to browse through the console history, by offsetting the console 
                                        output by N. Default key keypad - scrolls into the history (conskip 1) and 
                                        keypad + resets the history (conskip -1000).
                                        <pre><font size=3>    weapon a b c     </font></pre>
                                        Tries to select weapons a, b &amp; c, in that order, if they have ammo (0 = 
                                        fist, 1 = sg, 2 = cg, 3 = rl, 4 = rifle). If none of the 3 indicated have any 
                                        ammo, it will try the remaining weapons for one with ammo (in order 3/2/1/4/0) 
                                        (the fist needs no ammo). You can use the weapon command with 0 to 3 arguments. 
                                        examples:
                                        <pre><font size=3>
    weapon 2 1 0     // close up selection
    weapon 4 3 2     // far away selection
    weapon 3 2 1     // medium distance selection
    weapon 0         // humiliate selection :)
    weapon           // just switch to anything with ammo
    </font></pre>
                                        In any selection, it will skip whichever weapon you have currently selected, so 
                                        executing a weapon command repeatedly toggles between the two best weapons with 
                                        ammo within a given selection. default keys 0 to 4 select the corresponding 
                                        weapons, with sensible default alternatives, middle mouse button is a simple 
                                        weapon switch.
                                        <pre><font size=3>    gamespeed P     </font></pre>
                                        sets the gamespeed in percent, i.e. 50 is playing in slowmotion at half the 
                                        speed. does not work in multiplayer. for entertainment purposes only :)
                                        <pre><font size=3>    mode N     </font></pre>
                                        set gameplay mode to N for the next game played (next map load). N can be:

                                            0: "ffa" / "default" mode. This is the default normal ffa game, and can also be 
                                            used as "prewar" while setting up teams / voting for the next game.&nbsp;

                                            1: coop edit mode. This simply enables map editing in multiplayer, otherwise 
                                            identical to mode 0.

                                            of players: you are allied with all players whose "team" setting is the same as 
                                            yours. In general, all odd numbered modes (3/5/7/9) are the teamplay variant of 
                                            the even mode preceding it

                                            6/7: efficiency mode. No items will spawn, but everyone will get all weapons 
                                            with full ammo, and a yellow armour + boost on respawn.

                                            8/9: arena mode. as efficiency mode, but now when you die you stay dead until 
                                            one player remains. [note: this mode doesn't fully work yet]

                                        Frag counting is the same for all modes: 1 for a frag, -1 for a suicide or a 
                                        teamkill. Timelimit for all games is 10 minutes, or 15 minutes for teamplay, 
                                        and no timelimit for mode 1 (and mode 0 in a local game).

                                            Sets the skill level (1-10) for single player modes. Default = 3. Affects 
                                            number of monsters in DMSP mode, and general monster AI in all SP modes.
                                            <pre><font size=3>    sendmap     </font></pre>

                                            These two commands allow you to send other players maps they may not have while 
                                            in multiplayer mode, and easily keep maps in sync while doing coop edit. 
                                            "sendmap" reloads the current map you are on, then uploads it to the server and 
                                            sends every other player a message about it. Other players can then simply type 
                                            "getmap" to receive the current map, which is written to their local disk then 
                                            reloaded. A second variant "sendmap name" is available which is particularly 
                                            useful for coop editing, which first does a "savemap name" before performing 
                                            the actual "sendmap". Thus in both cases you must already be on the map you 
                                            want to send before issuing the command! (in some multiplayer that requires 
                                            voting). Also note that "getmap" operates on the last map send by some other 
                                            player, whatever it is.
                                            <pre><font size=3>    servermenu     </font></pre>
                                            displays the server menu. The server menu contains the last N servers you 
                                            connected to, sorted by ping (servers are pinged automatically when bringing up 
                                            this menu). Just select one to connect again. If you connect to a server by 
                                            typing "connect" manually, the server gets added here automatically. You can 
                                            also add servers to "servers.cfg" manually.
                                            <pre><font size=3>    updatefrommaster     </font></pre>
                                            contacts the masterserver and adds any new servers to the server list (written 
                                            to servers.cfg on exit). (see also multiplayer menu).
                                            <pre><font size=3>    savegame F     </font></pre>
                                            Saves the current state of game (map, state of entities, monsters, triggers, 
                                            and your player) to a savegame file named F (these are placed in the 
                                            "savegames" directory). Default key F8 is "savegame quicksave". Works only in 
                                            classic singleplayer mode.
                                            <pre><font size=3>    loadgame F     </font></pre>
                                        restores a previously saved game named F. Default key F9 is "loadgame 
                                        quicksave".&nbsp;You cannot load savegames from different versions of 
                                        the&nbsp;map, different versions&nbsp;of cube, or different cpu

                                you may want to get familiar with the various game modes cube has, and how to 
                                vote for other maps and modes (again, easily done using the multiplayer menu). 
                                Be cooperative with the other players on the server, and vote. Remember, press 
                                T to talk to others.

                                <li>
                                One of the computers on the LAN has to run server.bat. It really doesn't matter 
                                which.
                                <li>
                                The simplest way for all players to connect is for them to type "connect 
                                servername" in the cube console (press ` to get in the console), where 
                                servername is the network name or ip address of the machine running server.bat. 
                                if all went well you should now be in the game together, as above.

                                If your LAN is connected to the internet, by default your server will register 
                                with the masterserver, and players could thus follow the procedure above to 
                                join the game: your server will show up in the list, and may thus be joined by 
                                people over the internet! If you want to avoid your server to contact the 
                                master server, you can start it with -mblah or something.

                                very similar to Doom &amp; Quake, and is played on maps specifically designed

                                    about 1 per second), which will immediately be angry at you. The map ends when

                                    buddies ;). The number of monsters depends on the "skill" variable. Items

                            The damage given is for a single shot, where damage is simply a quarter of the 
                            equivalent player gun. For the shotgun this is if he hits you at point blank 
                            range, but is a lot less at distance. RL guy of course deals out splash damage 
                            too.

                            Stamina is the amount of damage taken before dying, speed is their movement 
                            speed in cubes/sec (player = 24), and freq is their relative frequency of 
                            spawning in DMSP mode.

                            "lag" is how long it takes them to press fire after they have decided they will 
                            shoot in a particular direction, which means you can out-strafe their bullets 
                            (but still get hit when standing still or moving towards them). The number is 
                            in msec on skill 0, and half as big on skill 10.
                            <P>
                            "rate" indicates how often they will attempt to shoot you while they have you 
                            in their sights. It is not an absolute fire rate measure, as fire rate is lower 
                            with distance and has some absolute minimum. Again, it is also dependant on 
                            skill (skill 10 fires twice as often as skill 0). "loyalty" indicates how often 
                            they have to be hit by another monster in a row before they fight back.
                            <P>
                            Other important parameters: monsters will at most jump down 4 cubes in height, 
                            unless their health is 100 or less, in which case they allways jump down.
                            <P>
                            As you can summise from the above, the keys to surviving in cube SP are: keep 
                            moving, preferably perpendicular to the monster line of sight, 
                            frequently&nbsp;move behind&nbsp;walls and back&nbsp;(this makes monsters 
                            search for you again, which delays them), and use monster infighting to your 
                            advantage.

                            than most games out there. The reason for this is that just about everything in 
                            cube is done clientside, not just movement (as is common in games today) but 
                            also aim (the fat client / thin server model).
                            <p>
                            The benefits of this are that the effects of lag are minimised, and someone on 
                            a 200 ping can compete on an almost even playing field with someone with a 20 
                            ping, the disadvantages are mainly in that its harder to combat cheating. 
                            Further advantages for server admins are that cube servers use virtually no 
                            cpu, and very little bandwidth for a lot of clients (you can host a 4 player 
                            game on a modem!).
                            <p>
                                It is impossible to completely hide lag however, and these are some of the 
                                effects that can still show lag if you or someone you play with has a high ping 
                                / bad connection:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        if the connection has packetloss. There is no direct indicator of packetloss, 
                                        instead the "packet jump" figure is provided on the hud (use "showscores"). 
                                        Packet jump says as much as the amount of milliseconds that pass between 
                                        updates from the indicated player. If it is extremely variable, or is 
                                        high(&gt;80) then your gameplay may be hampered (players jumping from place to 
                                        place). Ideally it is a steady 40 or lower. A consistent packet jump is more 
                                        vital to gameplay than ping.

                                        Cube uses player prediction based on extrapolation using the physics model, in 
                                        an attempt to be both as up to date as possible w.r.t. to the game state, and 
                                        as realistic w.r.t. to physics. However, under packet loss this model breaks 
                                        down and player movement becomes choppy.

                                        if ping is high (either yours or someone you play with), some actions may 
                                        appear lagged. The effect of ping is generally that the players in a game are 
                                        effectively playing more and more seperate games, as someone with a high ping 
                                        is "playing in the past". The local effects of this are masked out by client 
                                        side movement &amp; aim, but may become noticable across players:

                                                    you may get hit by someone even though you are already out of his view. This is 
                                                    because he is aiming at your movements of a while ago, and his hits take a 
                                                    while to arrive back at you. You may therefore be hit by gunfire up to his lag 
                                                    + your lag milliseconds after you leave his FOV.

                                                    the same time as someone else (server decides who was "first"). Item pickup is 
                                                    server side, only when you hear the sound effect have you actually picked up 
                                                    the item.

                                                    players dying appears lagged. This will improve.</li>

                                        <p></p>
                                    <li>
                                        if a player is severely lagged (or you are) he temporarily becomes a "ghost" 
                                        that cannot be hit (if &gt;1sec packet jump).</li>
                                </ul>
                            Network problems are currently worse than need be because cube uses TCP 
                            connections, but this should improve when it is moved to use UDP.
