                    - greatly optimized heighfield rendering, generates only a third or so of the

                    <br>

                    recalced on map load. This allows maps to keep up with lighting algorithm 
                    changes, and shrinks map sizes dramatically (aard1.cgz is now a mere 3k).
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    - added a "median cut" to the lighting code, which smooths out jaggies on harsh

                    - reengineered lighting code... insanely fast, but slightly different results

                    <br>
                    - added acurate frustrum culling to the occlusion culling mechanism (for pitch 
                    -45..45 cases, and floor/ceil culling). reduces polys yet again 20 to 30% on

                    <br>
