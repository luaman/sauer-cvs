// on every map load, this file will be executed, followed by
// "package.cfg" in the package dir of the map, and "<mapname>.cfg",
// which you can use to override the settings in this file.

// to make a custom version for your map, DO NOT COPY this file,
// but instead make a .cfg with only those things which are different
